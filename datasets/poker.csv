poker,We're all clowns here,
poker,There must be other Cheaters on Live Streams,"After consuming a lot of media about this, including Postle's interview, I have concluded that if this stooge, who cheated so stupidly and obviously, can get away with it for more than a year, it must be extremely easy to cheat when there is a live stream of the game.

There are always people willing to compromise ethics for money when the opportunity is there. So there must be other cheaters who are smarter and will never get caught."

poker,ACR Clusterfuck,"Hi!

With the frequent ACR crashes and subsequent frustration-induced posts, I figured I would post my own and how it has affected me personally.

My name is Barkered and I am a mid-to-high stakes MTT and PLO streamer, predominantly playing on America's Cardroom. I am also an ACR Stormer, but this may be short-lived as I cannot continue to promote a brand that is openly fucking its playerbase.

A crash on their site yesterday will now be its third within a nine day period (that I am aware of). I am still owed refunds for buy-ins and ICM chops for their crash on Sunday, October 6th, and am out nearly 5k in equity since that date. According to their policy, reimbursements are to be made within 24 to 72 hours; it has been nearly ten days.

I was severely shorted in what they have refunded me from that date. I had 350k in the $109 150k Warm Up with less than 300 players remaining. With the tournament average being 150k, quick math would say I was to receive \~$1,500; I received just north of a grand.

As a forensic accountant for nearly five years, it isn't my responsibility to do your accounting for you, especially on the basis of your fuck-up; nor is it the player's responsibility. From the recent posts on Reddit and 2+2, I know I wasn't the only one shorted. Would I put it past your site for this to have been done deliberately, to have your playerbase overlook the math, who are already consumed by the gameplay alone, and entrust your team's accounting?

Entrusting your team with anything at this point would be a mistake.

On that Sunday, I was also in the $1,050 200k. I lost access to this tournament, and a much smaller one, forcing me to effectively blind out. Was player accessibility, or lack thereof, taken into consideration when reimbursing your clients?

A simple spreadsheet would have dissolved all questions related to your figures and what was ultimately reimbursed. Would that be too much to ask? Undoubtedly, yes, from a site that cannot maintain an MTT schedule due to frequent ""DDoS attacks.""

The DDoS attack from that Sunday happened in a timely fashion. ACR was running a $630 40 Seat Venom Giveaway. Sitting 2/76 in the satellite, the site shuts down. Some have speculated that this was deliberate considering they had severely over-calculated the number of participants in this tournament. The DDoS worked in their favor, as they were no longer responsible for overlaying the nearly 60k in seats to the event. I simply received my buy-in back for the event.

As an ACR Stormer, I thought I would find more transparency between the players and the site; it has only had the opposite effect. It is a group who are made up of mostly subpar losing players who are incentivized to exclusively stream ACR, without acknowledging the blatant controversies the site itself stirs. I was lead to believe this group would act as a liaison and move in the interest of the players - it has been anything but that.

Wasn't ACR the old Doyle's Room from back in the day? The site could have offered 100% rakeback and no one would have played, because of inherent competition. The site promises 27% rakeback now and it isn't even given. The amount in arrears for me is in the thousands.

Isn't it telling that you have to create a ""250k FreeBuy Series"" to insinuate you care about your players for your own asserted mishaps? You have fucked your playerbase for far more than 250k; I remain out nearly 5k from that Sunday alone.

This will certainly continue until a real site offers action to the US, bringing with it principles to be implemented and upheld, and protection to the source of its revenue stream: the players."
poker,Tips for how to submit a proper hand analysis question on Reddit.,"Hi guys, some folks who are new to this sub and might be wondering what we all look for in a hand analysis post so I figured I would drop some helpful pointers.  Enjoy!

First off, make sure that you title the post ""roast my line.""  That way everybody knows that they can really give you honest and critical feedback.  It doesn't matter that you're going to argue in the comments with every single person who dares to insinuate that you're not a poker god who just got brutally coolered; You can cross that bridge when you get there.

Next.  It's super important that you let everybody know that Hero is TAG.  That way when you go on to describe a hand in which you 3-bet 97s from the big blind, everybody will understand that you only did it because you thought people would give more respect to your raises, what with your TAG image and all.

Another thing that's super important is for you to give as detailed as possible of a description of every villain involved in the hand.  Make sure we all know their gender, age, ethnicity, height, build, marital status, education level, sexual orientation etc.  You get the idea.  No detail is too important.  Definitely also make sure to include a detailed synopsis of the one hand where you saw them get to showdown as that's a going to be a super reliable indicator of their overall playstyle.  You know what they say ""if you've seen one hand you've seen them all.""  We need all the information we can get if you want honest feedback, so this stuff is way more important than the suits of your pocket queens on a board where a rainbow flop goes runner runner to a possible flush.

When describing the action, make sure to constantly flit back and forth between describing bet amounts in terms of dollars and also in terms of big blinds.  Most newcomers think that this is confusing and adds an unnecessary degree of difficulty to the task of analyzing the hand, but those of us who analyze hands frequently will tell you that we actually appreciate you keeping us on our toes.  By having to convert blinds to dollars and back again to follow along with your post, our synapses are firing at full speed and we are fully ready to comprehend the brilliance of your play.  If anything, try taking it one step further; throw some bitcoin and other crypto-currencies in there.  Not only will we appreciate the mental exercise, but it will also gives us an excuse to keep an eye on the current exchange rate.

Finally, and I kinda saved the best for last, you're gonna hear a lot of people referring to tens as T.  Ignore them.  You should always make sure to write 10 when describing any ten in the deck.  Especially when you have 1010.

Follow these guidelines and everybody on r/poker will love you for it.  You're welcome."
poker,"V tabled his cards in the middle of the hand; still managed to double me up, 1/3 at my local casino","So I was at my local casino playing 1/3 and got into an interesting spot which made my session a quite memorable one.

Let me start by saying V in this hand bought into the 1/3 game for about $4k-5k (biggest stack at table for this specific casino is max buy-in) and I’m sitting w about $300-$400. From what I had seen within the first few hours he was not a very skilled player (lots of limping, playing 60%+ of hands) and was easily tilted after losing the first few hands he was involved in. OTTH

I have 32o in BB (fold pre ik), V raises to 10, MP calls, I call because I can’t give up my $3 that easily of course (normally don’t play this loose, and honestly don’t have any justification for calling other than my gut feeling if anyone can believe it)

Flop comes 332r, I check, V bets 10, MP folds, and I call the 10. At this point V didn’t see me call and flips his hand over showing 36o giving him trips (was really excited to show I guess). At first I thought the hand was dead and was pretty tilted for losing value but the dealer said it still plays and V said “yea of course we can still play it”

Turn is offsuit 4, I check and V bets $50 into about ~$60 pot. I tank for about 10 sec and raise to $150 wanting to it seem bluffy. V snap calls and river is 10. Before I can even do anything V puts me all in out of turn and I snap and show the boat. 

He immediately left the table for a “walk” and left the casino not too long after.

Was just curious if anyone else has gotten max value against a tabled hand or been in a similar situation. Definitley a first for me, gotta love live low stakes"
poker,Having another tournament this Saturday in West Phoenix are if anyone is interested. More info in the comments,
poker,2-5 hand vs reg,"Villian is a regular in the game as am I.  We have played many hours together.  I consider him a good player.  Laggy style.  

&amp;#x200B;

6 handed, I'm in the BB with Q9dd (1k), folds to villian in the SB(covers) who limps.  I make it 20 he calls

flop (40) JhTc3h

villain check calls 25

turn (90) Kh

villain check, i make it 60, villian raise to 275 I call (never folding a straight on the turn to this particular villian)

river (610) 4h (villian jams for 650ish effective)

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely think he can have bluffs in this spot and jam here doesn't make a ton of sense given action, as I think he's raising any ace pre in SB v BB.  Also when I call turn I definitely have high hearts in my range so unless he just has the nuts he has to at least give thought to the possibility that I have it...  also given our dynamic I don't think its out of the realm of possibility that he could be value jamming worse... I don't think he just check/folds a set here to me

poker,On my way to the casino after I get a tip there's a whale at the tables.,
poker,Had a pretty improbable runout 99 vs T6s,"So I'm playing .20/.40 local home game with some buddies who are still in college. I just lost a $350 pot JTs vs 56 on a Q96A4 runout when he called my all in turn bluff. I rebuy in for $40 because fuckit don't wanna go home yet. Anyways, OTTH

Hero gets 9h9s in the CO. There's a 3 button straddle. SB, BB call. 56 guy calls. See all the dead money, I ship it for $28. Folds around to 56 guy, and he asks if I want a call. I'm like ""I don't care up to you"". He calls with Tc6c. We agree to run it 3 times.

First board:

Kc Ts Qc Th 2s

Second board:

8c 2c Td Ac 8s

At this point, I'm cracking up. I gotta win one run-out right?

Third board:

9d 2d 3s

(cool, I have a set, there's no flush draw, the only way he can win is if..

4s 5d

... he goes runner runner straight.)

It was just an absurd series of cards I guess that made this so funny. It's just like, 'huh, what are the odds of that?'"

Today playing two tables I was down 6 buy ins but after closing out one table and basically playing for six hours I broke even (well up an extra 28 cents but that’s not really something to write home about) 

I want to add an extra table but I also don’t want to lose money. How do I transition?"
poker,Anyone experience collusion on ACR 3.30 tourneys?,"Just saying, I make it to top 3 most times I choose to try a tourney out since I have been focusing on cash.

2 years of sng's on diff sites and haven't seen play like this on any site. In other 9 handed sng the pressure from players is pretty evenly distributed and they put it on each other, for sure tryna win it for themselves not fold to play final 2.

Everytime, i get to 3 handed play....it seems they do not play against each other at all... we are usually equaled out in chips too so it is obvious they definitely play against me w their strong holdings but fold them against each other.

So these regs are friends or just straight up pullin some collusion?
How would anyone ever know?"

poker,"I received “gold” cards in the mail 🤔 Turns out, a salesman closed a deal based on a recommendation I provided. Our Friday lunch tournament just became a high class event.",
poker,What are some things to look for while playing live?,"I have a decent amount of experience playing poker -- been into it for a few years and started playing when I turned 21 last year. I'm planning on going to my local card house for a free roll this Friday. I've placed in a couple of tourneys before, but mostly because I was just running really hot. I didn't feel like I out-skilled the other players.  


That said, what should I be looking for at the poker table? I'm pretty good at knowing my own odds of winning and knowing when/how to bet. But I typically never focus on the other players (or I forget/overlook important shit they might be doing). When the others are taking their turns, what do you guys typically look for? Their hands? Their eyes? Speech patterns, tics, etc. What patterns should I be looking for/paying attention to? It seems daunting to try to remember every little thing the 8 other people at the table are doing at any given time."

poker,Preflop caller betting OOP,"I have been running into this spot a couple of times in the last few sessions. Where the preflop caller, when I raise, will bet into me about 2/3rds - Pot on the flop when they are OOP. 

For example. I had As6s MP. Raised a limper [.02] to [.11] and the SB called. 

Flop comes Jd 10c Ah.

Villain bets .18 into a .22 cent pot. 

Hero?? 

Is this warning flag they flopped the nuts? Big draw? 

Another example 

AJo CO. Hero raises to .7, BB calls. 

Flop comes 855 

BB bets .9 into a .15 pot

Hero?? 

How should we normally handle situations like this? Polarized?"
poker,Played 2/5 with a $10 rock for the first time today. How much does the rock change pre-flop strategy?,"In general I felt treating it like 5/10 wasn't too far off but there were a few situations where it felt different.

For example if we're in the button, UTG is holding the rock, and it folds to us. Opening a wide stealing range to ~$25-30 to try to win $17 for free seems less enticing than usual when $10 of our winnings is a mandatory bet on the next hand. So I figured I should tighten up my stealing range a bit.

Also, if you happen to win a hand from UTG/BB, you're sorta saving a bit because the rock replaces your blind? Maybe you're meant to be a bit more aggressive from these spots?

Would love to hear any thoughts on how else my playstyle should change in this game."

poker,ZOOM 2NL discussion,"I´m making this post to share my insights on ZOOM 2NL player pool and learn and try to get better if you, the reader, want to help and share your insights aswell.

DISCLAIMER: I´M A LOSING POKER PLAYER WANTING TO BECOME A WINNING PLAYER, MY ONLY PURPOSE IS TO LEARN AND BECOME BETTER. NOW IF YOU THINK MY OPINION (AND I´M GONNA BE SHARING MY OPINION BIG TIME HERE) IS INVALID LEAVE THIS THREAD.

Short resumee (YOU CAN SKIP): I´ve started playing poker in 13/05/2019 in pokerstars, I have now a loss of 357€ (according to sharkscope). Most deposits were 20€, some were 10€ and one was 45€. When I started I used to play sit e gos, win some, lose some and then go on tilt playing headsup and lose all the money. Then I started to play tournaments, but still go on tilt on headsup and lose all the money. I started to prefer 1 or 3€ 6-max superstack tournaments (I love them) I get some top 30 results and many in the prizes (but it takes a lot of time and with this buy ins the prizes are small) But still I would lose all money on tilt on headsups or sit e gos. Then I heard of 888poker, I went there, no deposit and got to 20€ with sit e gos and tournaments, the oponnents are definetly weaker here, but still I tried higher stakes (like 10NL SNAP (ZOOM) ) and lost the money.  Last week I put 20€ on pokerstars and finally I manage to consistently win money with ZOOM 2NL, managing  to reach 34€...... I manage to last a week, playing every day (my record, I´m improving) but then yesterday I went on tilt, I went to 10NL and fucked my money \^\^....  I lack discipline, you see..

Anyways, I´ve made profiles of type of players and also some tells I get (which the majority of 2NL player population does) and I want to share this so you guys can tell me what you think about it.

**PLAYER TYPES**

**TIGHT**\-Player who isn´t completely retarded but plays fewer hands, raise small and with big hands, doesn´t call if he has nothing and generally only bets when he has something.

**Chicken**\-Limper and min bet lover but doesn´t call raises unless he has a premium or has a strong hand

**Coward**\-Limper and min bet lover but calls raises almost everytime, the most fish alike player on the list.

**Traper**\-This retard, EVRYTIME he has a premium he limps-3bet or limps-shove and when he has something postflop he will min bet-call or min bet-shove. When he makes a solid bet, that might be a bluff. 

**Fish**\-(you can call almost all of these players fish but this guy is particulary fishy) He doesn´t know wtf he´s doing. calling a big 3bet with A2off, going allin flop with a pair of 6 etc..

**Small time bluffer**\-This guy bluffs, but his bet sizings are small.

**Big time bluffer**\- Big bluffs, like pot and allin

**Standart**\- This guy is straightforward, few bluffs, but not a tight player, probably the most solid player type.

**AGRO**\-This player will either 3 bet a lot or c-bet a lot and barrel a lot or all of this things.

**LOOSE**\-Calls a lot

**Loose Agressive**\- The typical LAG, we all know what´s a LAG, not much to be said

**Maniac**\-No fold button, super wide ranges, big time bluffer, bla bla bla

&amp;#x200B;

**TELLS and STUFF**

**SNAP CALL**\- The biggest tell of them all, 90% of times, they either have draws or second pairs or nothing and they will call flop and if you bet the turn, they´ll fold. But few players will snap call with high pair low kicker. Even fewer will snap call with nothing but won´t fold. And the rarest snap caller is the snap caller with the nuts, which is weird.

**Raise River**\-Nuts

&amp;#x200B;

That´s about it for now.."

poker,I am a noob I need help,"So I just wanted to have a little bit of fun playing a 3$ dollar tournament nl08, in which I am a total fish.  I have a question about a small pot that didn't cost me much but I just don't get it:

My hand was Ac 8h KS 6d

Villains hand was Jh Js 3c Kh

poker,2/3 Line Check,"This one is really bugging me from the other night.

Utg (older, not a complete nit but plays pretty tight and straightforward) limps, I raise to 15 in CO with kxqc, button (loose reg) calls, utg calls. I’m the effective stack of 200$

Pot: $45

Flop: 9c 10c jx. Utg bets 20, me and button call.

Turn: 9

Pot: $105

Utg bets 50. I put the rest of my stack in (~150), button thinks for a sec, goes all in as well, putting utg all in and he calls. At this point I pretty much know I’m dead.

River 9, button shows jj, utg shows 10’s

Wanted to get feedback on how I played flop and ultimately shipped turn. My thoughts throughout:

- I flat with the nuts on the flop and decide not to play fast thinking there’s a good possibility utg has the baby straight or some type of medium flush/combo draw and I hold a big club in my hand, so wouldn’t exactly hate seeing a club on the turn.

- i did not like seeing the 9. After utg leads again on the turn despite getting two calls, I’m not really sure what my thought process was leading me to decide to ship despite having flopped such a strong hand. I was sitting waiting all night and just decided to go for it. In retrospect though, against a straightforward player like him is this an automatic fold when the board pairs? Button having top boat like he did here seems rare, I feel like given how the flop action went he’s the one drawing most of the time

How to sort this one out in real time would be helpful, as would the math. Thanks"

Edit 2: Thinking more about that hand is the line villian took any good? I think I should have folded and am probably folding a weak J in a similar situation. I think if the turn bet was closer to pot and a oversized river shove would probably make more sense especially with the K hitting his range better than mine

Villian limped JJ a few hands earlier and 4 bet a squeeze earlier with 33 a few hours earlier playing 7 handed. Seems capable of making a bluff."

Were you slow playing Queens?  Really?  Queens?  Fuck this is so sick"" and the YG tables his hand and it is JJ for the boat...  He says, ""You have Queens huh? You are so effing nitty Really?  so sick, this dealer always kills me..."" after another minute of this he says ""F--k it nice hand, I know you got me beat, OK I call...""

OMC turns over 4s for the quad fours...

YG announces proudly, ""I Knew it!!!!  I knew it. I fucking knew it!!!!""

so funny to me that so many players just can't fold big hands... after the hand everyone at the table and I mean EVERYONE was like, ""Well, you had a boat, you have to call!""

If you learn nothing from this forum, learn this...  nits never fucking c/r ship all-in on the river for 200bb+ (in this case 400bb) without the stone cold nuts.  They just don't.

And when they do the dramatic woe-is-me-sigh-shrug-sigh and then c/r ship it all-in for significantly more than the pot, it is the stone cold nuts.  Every. Fucking. Time.

At worst, it is the 2nd nuts and that is slumming it for them..."

Villain: 112k. Limps too much, calls a bit too much. Not much more of a read than that.

Hero: 110k. Has made large raises pre-flop, won an all-in pot with MPTK, etc.

Blinds at 3k/6k.

Villain:  Limps in 2nd or 3rd.

Hero, in position (Kd6d): raises to 15k.

Folds to villain who calls.

**Flop**

Hero: c-bets 12k.

Villain calls.

**Turn**

Ax Qx 9h (8h)

Check

Check

**River**

Ax Qx 9h 8h (Kh)

Villain bets 26k.

Hero: tanks for about a minute, then shoves (approx 60k on top)

I'll post the rest of the results later. But based on this, what would you put him on? Any glaring mistakes I made, taking the blinds structure into account?

**Edit:** RESULTS.

After I shove he tanks for like 3 minutes, which is light-years in this game. 'Did you hit the flush?' etc. 

He calls with JcTs.  For some reason I didn't even think of putting him on a straight, which is part of the reason why I jammed, and also why I posted that title. In hindsight I should definitely should have put him on it, players had been chasing draws all night. But I guess being a middle straight draw on the flop is why I missed it."

I made it $11 to go pre flop.. small blind calls using all white chips. He was in seat 7, I'm in seat 2, so my view was kind of obstructed. I swear I only saw him put $10. The dealer was distracted, too busy in the middle of a conversation. Everyone else folds. Heads up. The dealer swept up the bets and made a pot. flop: J-J-2

Small blind checks, Action is on me, but I stop and ask the dealer ""did he put in the full $11? I think he shorted a dollar"" so the dealer recreated the pot, but while he's doing that, he tells me ""check or bet, c'mon it's only a dollar, make your move""

Turns out, small blind put the full amount in, but the $10 white were blocking his $1 dollar small blind.

People kept looking at me like, ""you really made a big deal over one missing dollar?"" I've never felt so nitty lol I continuation bet after everything was settled and sb folded, I tipped that ""missing"" dollar to the dealer.

To the point, the dealer that had been a smart ass pushed me a nice sized pot, I said “I think my tip to you and the rest of the staff is, don’t berate players especially on a chopped pot, thank you guys for the ~1800 win I am going to the hotel, good luck” To this I got the entirely expected reaction of your an ass, and too bad anyone ever pushed you a pot along with some other bating insults.

A couple hands later, he wins a medium sized pot, and tips 10 dollars and goes ""Now THAT is how your supposed to tip!""

I can't bite my tongue any longer. I say ""Todd, did you know we actually tip the same amount over the course of the night? I just tip more often because I win more.""

poker,Does it EVER make sense to fold AA preflop?,"I came across this situation at a Casino tournament this past weekend, and I've been kicking this around in my head ever since. The tourney was down to the final table bubble, and I was sitting on 2nd chip stack. First place was sitting directly to my right. I opened 2.5x UTG with AA, and got a call from the button. BB (chip leader) 3 bets to 8x, I 4 bet to 25x, and button folds. BB 5 bets all in and I call. He has KK, and spikes a K on the flop. I'm eliminated, and miss out on the final table pay bump.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the BB played the hand fine, but what I'm wondering, is if it's ever the smart play to fold AA? In order to better paint a picture, the chip leader and I combined for at least 50% of the chips in play. Had I just folded, I could have easily sailed into 4th or 5th without winning another hand. Instead, AA got cracked and I went home with way less money.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know if this were cash game play, I would call the AA every time. I know that calling with AA is always profitable in the long term, but in a tourney, I'm not sure that is always the case. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure this question is going to get a lot of hate, but I'm just wondering if there's ever a time when the correct ***tournament strategy*** here is to fold."

poker,Question on a river decision $1/2 live,"Bally's in Vegas a couple weeks back, curious about a river decision I made. 

Been at the table for an hour or so at this point, tad slow and nitty to the point where I was planning on leaving in another orbit. Villain in this hand was the only guy I pegged as non-passive at the table, only guy that wouldn't open limp, rarely over limped, basically always raising if he was getting in the pot. I'm the effective stack at about $215, villain covers table. 

There's an utg+1 limp, additional limp from MP, villain on button raises to $10, I call in BB with 78cc, limpers call. 

Flop comes Tc9s4s. $40 in pot. Checks to villain how bets $25, I call, everyone else folds. 

Idiot end of an open ender, with a backdoor flush draw. I made a bad assumption that one of the limpers would call giving me better odds on this. Lots of turns that give me equity and the ability to possibly bluff, I've seen villain double or triple barrel often, but folds to check raises back so that's always an option later. 

Turn is Tc9s4s-6s. $90 in pot. Good news, nut straight. Bad news, wrong flush comes in. I check, villain bets $50, I take my time and call. I considered a raise, since my hand only gets weaker at this point, lots of cards I don't like on the river, but with the obvious flush coming in, felt a raise would mean he could fold most I'm beating, short of sets probably. I made this call with the assumption that I'm check-calling basically any non spade. 

River is Ts9s4s-6s-3h. $190 in pot. I check, villain bets $100, I call with $30 left behind after the call. 

I'm overall okay with how I played this. Other people I may have raised on turn to try to ensure the pot would build, but I had the right read on villain that he'd keep barreling away. 

What I am wondering is the $30 left behind. I feel like adding that in is just torching money, very typical 'anything I'm ahead of folds, anything I'm behind calls'. But that mindset could be the 'scared of the monster' and assuming he takes this line mostly with his flushes."

1. Is Mandalay Bay a good place to play 1/2 NLHE or PLO? I'm wondering if the players are the soft, recreational type. I'd prefer to stay here and I'm hoping it's a good room to play at.
2. Tipping etiquette for the dealers. If I win a hand, do I tip the dealer, if so how much? Or do I wait until I leave the table for the night and give him/her a specific amount? I don't want to be rude.
3. If you don't recommend Mandalay Bay, where else are there soft games?

1. Is it acceptable to pull chips back then put chips out to complete an action? I.e. im in Bb(1/3). Button raises to $15. I pull my 3 whites from the pot and put 3 reds in to call. Is this acceptable or should i throw 3 reds and say call and let the dealer do the change?

2. Is it ok to keep chips not in play(reload chips) in the cupholder? Or should i keep them in my pocket? Should i announce topping off amount(when no hands in play) or just add them on?

3. I never missed a BB, but if i did miss a bb do i owe it? Im assuming for tournament id owe my bb if i missed it but if i miss it in cash i assume i just have to post a bb to rejoin the action before the bb hits me other wise i have to wait for the rotation of the bb to hit me again?

4. If max buy in is say 300. And im up to 450 and request a table change. Upon sitting at the new table do i sit with my 450 in play or have to reset back to 300?

5. If a seat goes vacant can i just freely move into that seat when no hands in play?

poker,Zoom: QQ in 4bet pot,"Need help with this kind of scenario, as I always end the hand feeling uncertain. Thanks!

Blinds $0.10/$0.25
Hero on BTN is dealt QQ. Hero is effective stack at 100bb.

CO raises $0.62. Hero raises to $2.12. SB raises to $7.23. CO folds, Hero calls.

Preflop: SB cold 4bet screams strength, but QQ in position is still a reasonably comfortable call. No reads on villain. Against a super tight range of AA/KK/AK I believe I have enough equity to see a flop in position; but should I be considering 5bet jamming?

Flop ($15.33): 982r

V bets $7.32. Hero calls.

Folding on this flop would make calling preflop redundant, even facing a decent sized bet. I’m really only hoping though that V slows down on the turn.

Turn ($29.97): 6s

V bets $17.08 and is all-in. Hero folds.

Most likely it’s just KK/AA, but it could also be AK with the blockers to KK/AA taking advantage of my perceived weakness preflop (flatting the 4bet). Not entirely sure.

Any advice on this hand, and this scenario in general, is much appreciated :)"

poker,The real reason we know Mike P is cheating.,"

**I have been playing poker  for 8 years and Im going to start by saying this:**  


Its not easy to win  at poker, it takes a lot of hard work and dedication. Only a small % of poker  players actually win money in the long run(due to rake from the house, and skill  gaps etc.)  


Lets assume we have no video footage of mike staring at his  crotch every hand, lets say we have no footage at all of mike even playing  poker.  
Lets say his actions are not even suspicious. All we know are the  numbers and were even going to skew them in mikes favour as much as  possible.  


I think most poker players would agree that the average live  crusher wins at an avg **big blind per 100 hands** of **25bb/100**(its  probably less than that tbh).   


For arguments sake, lets assume the  best live poker cash game player in the world right now is **Jimmy**, lets  say Jimmy's win rate is a whopping **50bb/100** when playing at stones  live casino with a very high **std deviation of 125**(to increase  variance). A winrate like this is un heard of in poker but well assume its  real just to help Mikes case. The odds of Jimmy with this winrate going on a  run similar to Mike postles is **mathematically impossible** and this can  be calculated.  


Now lets say Mike is even better than that. Lets ignore  the interviews of mike actually explaining his thought process. Lets say Mike is  a **""GOD"".** Lets give him a winrate higher than Jimmy. Lets say that Mike is  3 times better than Jimmy at a staggering **150bb/100** the best win rate the  poker world has ever come close to seeing. Lets give him a high std deviation as  well to increase his variance(**125**). Mike played a lot of poker at stones  and I think we can safely assume at an avg live game **(30 hands per hour)**  Mike has played close to **10k hands** on film. People need to understand 10k  hands is a lot of hands and can in fact prove many things. We don't know for  sure yet what Mike's win rate is over those hands due to the many graphics  errors but i think its very safe to assume he was winning anywhere between  **600-1000bb/100**, only time will tell.  


Now, lets see what the  probability of Mike(3 times better than the best live  
player in the world)  running at a whopping **600bb/100** over 10k hands actually is.  


After  simulating it on a widely used poker variance calculator([https://www.primedope.com/poker-variance-calculator/](https://www.primedope.com/poker-variance-calculator/))  
We  come to the conclusion that:  


**EV (»?«) 150.00 BB/100**  
**Standard  deviation (»?«) 125.00 BB/100**  
**Hands(»?«) 10000**  
**Expected winnings (»?«)  15000.00 BB**  
**Standard deviation after 10000 hands (»?«) 1250 BB**  
**12.50  BB/100**  
**70% confidence interval (»?«) \[13750 BB, 16250 BB\]**  
**\[137.50 BB/100,  162.50 BB/100\]**  
**95% confidence interval (»?«) \[12500 BB, 17500 BB\]**  
**\[125.00  BB/100, 175.00 BB/100\]**  
**Probability of loss after 10000 hands (»?«)  0.0000%**  
**Probability of running at or above observed win rate (600.00 BB/100)  over 10000 hands with a true win rate of 150.00 BB/100 (»?«)  0.0000%**  
**Probability of running below observed win rate (600.00 BB/100) over  10000 hands with a true win rate of 150.00 BB/100 (»?«) 100.0000%**  
**Minimum  bankroll for less than 5% risk of ruin (»?«) 156 BB**  


It is in fact  **mathematically impossible** for a man 3 times better than the current best  player in the world to actually win at these rates over a very big sample of  10,000 hands. **Online poker sites have in fact caught plenty of cheaters and  bots in the past based on their win rates and gameplay alone.** This man is  cheating in broad daylight on camera and people are debating this?"
poker,Non Mandatory Straddle...,"Another question. 

This is another Pacific Northwest thing. The only game of any decent size that was running was 2-5 PLO8, brush says max buy in of 2k with the six other players having 5k+ in front of them. I buy in for the max and sit down anyway. I ask “is the $25.00 straddle mandatory?” My thought was if it is I am going to GTFO of the game, because 2k when the standard open is 50-100  with 3-4 callers. Straddle isn’t mandatory, so it comes to me and I don’t do it. I quickly almost triple up when it should have been my straddle. Someone tacks on and I am then told, oh we changed it so you can goto 80% of the largest stack just a bit ago and today is just a rare day. They have 0 clue how to play PLO8 AA9Q is played like it is god four callers at 250, I continue to not straddle and almost double up again. I don’t straddle again, pot control is working for me in the situation. One guy bitches that I am not straddling and quits when his straddle comes around. Someone else says you don’t straddle, I quit which I am fine with I like short handed PLO8 anyway and both of these guys weren’t going to tack on and short stacked. Well they quit game breaks within just a few minutes, my thought is cool, book a very nice win cash out. Two large stacks that are obviously better than average say “thank you nit for breaking our fucking game.” I said nothing and left. I was just trying to practice pot control and not go totally nutty out of the box. What does everyone see as the correct play? My thought was I see these guys once every few years and I don’t give a rats if they think I am a nit, happy with the win."

Villain ends up calling with 9d9s and scoops the 600bb+ pot as the river bricks.Thoughts? I could maybe size a little less preflop, like 130-ish to c-bet 100-ish and shove for 375 instead on turn but then this UTG guy is not likely to fold easily after Villain calls my 3bet..I was kinda sad he did that call, not beating much of the range I'm representing, but I guess the open-ended turn draw grew him balls to do so.

poker,"Can someone explain to me ""slow rolling"" - am I an ass?","I understand the basis of it I think, but is check/calling when u have a next to guaranteed winning hand also considered slow rolling?

**I'm very new to the game** and was accused by a friend of slow rolling because I was check/calling with a A/K flush on the flop but to my knowledge a slow roll is if I was taking long to make a decision pretending to be concerned about my hand, but I wasnt doing this.

I called every raise he made simply because I knew he would continue to raise me until I raised him on the river. My intentions were to gain as many chips as possible from the hand and I was clear about that after. 

I just watched a slow roll compilation on youtube and it seems like most people on there were acting on the river as if they had a shit hand and/or being overdramatic, however I made all my calls I'd say probably within 5 seconds. Near enough immediately. 

Did I slow roll him and am I an ass for making him continue to raise knowing I more than likely had the best hand

poker,Questions about PLO hole card combos and equity... etc.,"So, one thing I was thinking of lately, what are the most important things to have in your hole cards in PLO.

&amp;#x200B;

I know what things matter but I want to have a more in depth discussion about why and the order of importance.

&amp;#x200B;

Things like single/double suitedness, overall connectedness for straights, highcard/kicker things to look out for in your hole cards.

&amp;#x200B;

One specific quesstion, which hand is better in omaha? Kc8c7sQh or Kh8c7sQc? Does the suitedness make a difference when you consider that it makes a suited 3-gap instead of offsuit? Or are the scenarios where this difference will play just too few to have an impact?"

0.273= 3/8+3

How do you get that %? I’m terrible with math so it’s probably going to be pretty obvious but better to ask a stupid question than not understand something."

poker,2 nitty folds last night? Deep run MTT questions,"Hey all, 

Made a pretty deep run last night, wound up in 15th in a $4000 GTD which was a grind all day but I made 2 folds that I thought were quite nitty, could you analyze?

Hand 1: 

27 left, sitting on 30 BB's.  Hero on button with QQ.  UTG, chip leader at table open shoves. folds all around to me, i tank fold. Played with V for around 30 mins at this point and didn't see him open shove once.  He also didn't do more than min bet in hands prior and was not on tilt so I figured he had AA as this seems to be a common move with AA

Hand 2:  19 left, sitting on around 27 BB's.  Hero in MP with AKo.  Folds to me, I raise to 2bb.  Button raises to 5BB, BB shoves all in which covers me.  I want to FT but we're 2 elims off a nice pay jump so I tank fold.  I felt that this was a pretty nitty fold at the time but I feel even worse about it now lol

At this point, these 2 folds could've either made or broke me.  I was playing for 7 hours at this point and I wasn't trying to bust like that.  What do you think?"

Turn 4s (109). CO 50, I call.

River 9c (209) CO x, I 265, villain tanks. He says this is so sick, he has a low flush but I bet 3x the pot (???). He asks if I will show if he folds. I tell him if he tips the dealer a fiver I will show. He says £2. I say £3 final offer. More tank.

Eventually he mucks and throws the dealer £3, I show him 56ss.

At this casino (Empire in London) they have a promotion where if you win a hand with 56 suited you don't pay any rake for the rest of the session, so it had to be done. Obviously even if he just mucks without tipping I show anyway because I have to show for the promo.

IDK if he really had a low flush, that would seem like an incredibly strange hand to take this line with (lead, lead, check/fold). He might have said that to get a read.

poker,Variance in HUPLO,"How does variance in HUPLO compare to variance in 6 max PLO. I watch watching Jnandez PLO mastermind course, and he mentioned in a video that HUPLO has LOWER variance than 6 max PLO. And I'm not sure if he made an accidental mistakes recording and forgot to reedit or if hes actually right.

Wouldn't HUPLO be extremely high variance compared to 6 max (just as HUNL compared to 6 max)? Ranges are wider and its PLO. Unless theres some reason why HUPLO is actually lower variance? Maybe we get it in less because ranges aren't as strong as 6 max?

Hand 1:

Effective stack CO ~180

Hero UTG, button straddle in for 5, both blinds call, hero raises to thirty with QQ, folds around, unknown in CO flats and BU flats. 

Flop comes 634r, hero bets 45, CO ships 120 BU folds.

Hand 2:

Effective stack hero ~260

Hero with AA UTG+1, UTG (ATC loose passive) makes it five to go, Hero raises to 30, one caller in MP and UTG flats. 

Flop comes AK5hhh, hero bets 40, one fold UTG flats. Turn 9h checks around, river brick and he leads for 25 (lol) 

Hero?

3 hands later, Hand 3:

Effective stack is hero with about 180

Hero with AKo UTG+1, button straddle is on, raises to thirty, three callers including two players who have shown down boats and flushes with hands such as 92o, 35o, 69s, etc etc.

Hero (me) is on the button with 2-3 of clubs.  UTG+2 and HJ (think I got that right) limp call, I limp, SB raises to 15¢, BB makes it 20¢.  UTG+2 calls, HJ folds, I call, SB calls.

Flop is A45 all spades.  I flop the wheel but on a very wet board.  SB checks, BB leads for 40¢, UTG+2 calls, I call for pot control (in hindsight I should’ve raised here), SB folds.  Turn is a 4 of hearts.  BB makes it 80¢, UTG+2 calls, I think for a second and then call.

River is King of clubs, backdoor flush draws miss.  Now I’m worried about a flopped flush or full house.  BB leads for $1.50, UTG+2 thinks, then folds.  I tank for about 4 minutes then sigh call, BB turns over the second nut flush.

My thought is that for the price I was getting I couldn’t have folded, although realistically there wasn’t much that he could’ve had that I beat.  Any set made a boat, and any flipped two-pair holding also made a boat.  The best I could hope for was something like A5, AK, or just trip fours.  Thoughts?"

poker,1/3 Line Check?,"Hey guys, wondering if I can get some feedback on a hand I played in 1/3 a couple months ago.

Pre-Flop: V2 is effective stack with $700. V1 raises cutoff to $15, V2 button 3b to $65. I look down at 65o in the SB and flat, which might seem a little loosey goosey but I have a strong read that V1 has exactly AsQc while V2 has AhKh. Given that my opponents ranges are exactly these hands, I think I can call profitably here. V1 calls as well.

Flop: Jc9h5s. Great flop for me because I am crushing opponents range. I decide to lead for equity denial and bet $90, only V2 calls.

Turn: 10h. Not a great card because V2 picks up some good equity. I check, he bets $200. I have to call and hope V2 does not hit.

River: 8s. Phew safe. I check it to induce, and V2 jams into me. I stare at my crotch just to make sure my preflop read was correct, as I think I can really discern a lot about villains hand by admiring my manhood. Again, since his range is literally only one hand I can call safely knowing I am literally always good. 

Crazy hand I know, should I change my line at all? Not everyone can make these reads, but I know I'm one of the best and I'm not afraid to admit it anymore."

poker,20NL hand review,"Hey guys, played a crazy hand in 20NL the other day. Had been grinding it out for 22 minutes prior to this and had dropped from my buy in of $20 to $5.79 because of shitty variance. So frustrating when you defend your BB with T4o and flop middle pair on a A42r board and the V shows up with AK like a fucken jabroni. Anyway, OTTH.


So I wake up from my slumber with AQs on the button and after a loose aggro maniac UTG raised to 0.80 I decided to rip in my remaining $5.79. He called with AJo and we decided to run it twice because I know online poker is rigged. Boards run out AJT95 and JJK8Q so I lose a massive pot. 


My question is whether or not more rake is better for me in this situation since I’m losing my stack but the rake is meant to go back to me right?

I think my image at the final table would have been playing well when I had a big stack and fairly normal ranges, although a google would indicate that I’m a funplayer.

Player 2: (SB) 15.25 BB - good reg 

Hero: (BB) 17.25 BB

Pre: Villain opens to 2.5BB. This is his standard open size and has been doing it most hands since he became chip leader. 

Hero wakes up with QxTc and calls. Unsure if this is a fold due to slightly covering the SB and the big sizing. 

Flop comes 2x8c9c. Player 2 and Hero both have 14.5BB behind. 

Villain cbets 1/2 pot , which he has done for every pot he opened pre at the final table. With 2 overs, a gutter and a backdoor clubs I shove.

so when ur watching and thinking wow i could win like them, it's usually that they are only playing there because they are paid to play there

also the gg graphs dont include rake"
poker,1/3 live roast my line,"I won this hand but I know it's important not to assume I played it correctly so I want other opinions. Game plays more like 2/5.

I apologize for the length of this post in advance.


V1 is an older MAWG fish who was winning, but down from his high point. Hated to fold, especially if he had a piece of the board. Saw top pair cost him a lot of money during the session. Covers the table.
V2 is mid 30s player who is new to the table and hasn't played many hands but seems passive. Stack around 400.
Hero has been playing solid but leaning more towards the aggressive side. Stack of 443.

V1 opens UTG+2 for 25, bigger than his usual open sizes. V2 calls on button. I look down at black queens in the sb as i'm eating. I acted quickly and only called. 
My reasoning was that v1 is more likely to commit to a top pair on a 10 or j high board hand and double me up than he is to commit to an A-J or 88 type hand pre. V2 is very unlikely to get sticky pre without Jacks or better. Plus if i re-raise while eating, it looks even stronger than usual and i chase away potential customers. I know I shouldn't play queens like aces and I'm increasing my variances, but I'm trying to win a big one from V1.

Flop is 7 5 4 with 2 diamonds. I check and v1 bets 75. V2 doesn't take long and calls.
Pretty sure at this point I can rule KK OR AA out of   v2's range if I couldn't already. His hand feels like diamonds, 8s, 9s or 10s, or a flopped set, heavily weighted towards the first two.
With V1, I don't think he's opening that large with 7s, 5s or 4s. His hand feels like AK or that same range of pocket pairs that i assigned to V2.

Feeling that my hand is significantly underrepped, i put in my remaining 418, and my opponents both fold, although v1 gave it some thought. 

I felt like a boss in the immediate aftermath, but looking back I think maybe I'm more likely to be crushed than I was thinking at the time. Everyone feel free to tell me if I played this poorly. Thanks!"
poker,Did I make the wrong move,"So I was playing an online mtt and was on the bubble sitting behind the blinds. Had 2 J’s, and shoved 1/3rd my stack at the final table.

I feel like usually I’d be okay making that move and losing but on the bubble that just hurt me hard. What would you guys do ?"

The guy who called my all in threw his hand into the muck right after the river card came out. I never pulled an angleshoot or said anything about the hand before showdown. He simply threw his hand into the muck, and when I showed ace high, he grabbed his cards from the muck and showed a winning hand, (pocket 3s) which the dealer honored. I called the floor over and they let the ruling stand. If I throw my hand into the muck, I'm forfeiting my hand. It's that simple. I don't see why he was allowed to stack me after mucking, and I will always remember this. Duck you Mohegan Sun. You just lost a reg"

poker,"Thought about this hand over the course of th last day and I’m pretty confident I made a bad call here, do you guys agree?","1/1 live cash game. Couple of limps to me in the cutoff and I limp behind with 97cc. Blinds check and we see a flop of J52cc. MP bets 5 into 6, I call, SB calls, EP calls.

Turn (25) is the 6c and MP tanks a minute or so then bets 20. I raise to 65, SB folds and EP, who is new to the table but appears semi-competent, after spending like 5 minutes deciding what to do, jams for 230 total. MP folds and the action was back on me.

As played I spent a couple minutes wondering if he ever makes this move with the naked Ac, and not sure if he’d play it this strongly if he genuinely did have the nut flush. I essentially told myself some version of “If he’s got it he’s got it” and I talked myself into a call, river rolls off some blank and I get shown A3cc.

Looking back, I think I should have folded. I am repping a flush when I raise here. In a heads up pot you can justify the call. Maybe he doesn’t believe me, maybe he doesn’t want me to draw with a one club hand. As is, even if he doesn’t believe me, MP has clearly got some kind of a hand to bet flop and turn, and it’s unlikely EP is cold 3 betting the flop in an attempt to get folds out of what appear to be 2 legitimately strong hands. It’s also completely impossible that he’s ever value shoving worse, or thinks I somehow fold a flush here.

Thoughts? Cooler, or should I be finding a fold 3 ways here?"

Unsure if 1/2 pot is too large 3 way in 3bet pot (maybe 33% and 75% when we barrel turn?) when the 10 hits the turn I feel v has it majority of time so c turn and allow villain to bluff the two flush draws out there. Can't fold river in this spot imo with pot odds but feels like I'm rarely good here even though he can bluff missed flush draws. What should villains defend to squeeze range look like oop?

poker,"Offered a stake, should I?","Ok so I play poker for fun, im a young adult and got into poker through a family friend of mine. Over the last two years I have began to play more and more regularly and have spent lots if time studying the game.

Most of the time I play 1/2 NL and go with only 400$ to the poker room. I play tight and strong poker but at 1/2 that doesnt do much good because all the regs are retired nits. Occasionally on the weekends a drunk rich guy will sit down and I can leave with $1000+, but thats about as good as I can book a win at 1/2. 

Now the 2/5 game at the poker room is capped at 500. I dont mind it because it allows for lower BR to play. Sometimes when the list for 1/2 is too long ill go sit and play 2/5. Out of my 6 times playing 2/5 I have booked winnings of over $2000. I know thats I just ran hot and got great hands and had beginners luck and what not, but it felt like real poker, the poker I study. 

I have recently became friends with a mutual friend who is really big on investing and looking to expand his portfolio. He thinks im a good player based on the home game we met at and wants to ""invest"" in me. He offer me a $10k bankroll for 2/5 and told me its just a start. Should I take a stake from a friend? Im confident in my playing but not confident in variance and dont want to lose my friends money. $10k is nothing to him but thats more money than I have ever had from poker. 

I dont want to miss out on a chance to play 2/5 which I believe is the starting stakes for real poker playing and turn down this offer, is staking a good way to start playing higher stakes? I know Poll started his career w a stake but im not at that level, is it worth the risk? 

I want advice from people who have done cash staking and if it is a good way to play.

poker,"Tough river spot, would you call?","Hi guys, first time posting here and I'm a player new to online playing in 0.25/0.5 zone on ignition. Although I won this hand I'm not sure if this was the correct decision to make and if it might be a losing play in the long run.

It starts six handed with villain UTG and myself in the button with KK. He raises UTG to 3BB and I raise to 10BB and the rest fold and he calls making it heads up. 

The flop comes: As Ad Qs. He checks and I bet 1/2 pot and he check raises my bet by x2.5 and I call. The turn is a 2d. The action goes check check. The river is a 7h making the final board As Ad Qs 2d 7h and he jams for 1.5x the pot and I tank before making the call. He shows J9h and I stack him.

The reason why I called here was that I thought it would be weird for someone to check raise with an ace or AQ or QQ as they are very strong ""nut"" hands and would kill action if I was trying to bluff. With that I put him on some hand like KQ or QJ and was just trying to punish me for trying to steal the pot (but weird since AK, AQ, QQ is definitely in my three betting range). So do you think this was a profitable call or was this a crazy hero call?"

Weird spot given the action. I think biggest mistake according to some mentoring is i should have 4bet jammed preflop but i think even JJ finds a fold and sometimes QQ. Yes hes aggressive but are we really just jamming to iso and protect our equity. If we get called we can guarantee we are in trouble. I have extensive history with V1 bc we both played for awhile at this small casino. 

With there only being 30 dollars in the side pot theres 0 reason to bluff me out of the hand since he still has to beat the guy all in. Due to the unknown flatting i also thought this guy could be blocking some of our outs a fair percentage of the time. Which is why i was hoping to only get him to call preflop.

While I’ve been here in Germany, I’ve recently been going to a local Speilbank (German Casino) and play in their 1/2 game. Usually the game is pretty soft and just a really good time. 

Last night early, I went all in with AK, MAWG had AAs and I ended up losing. I had him covered by €18. For the next 2 hours I was on the grind with that 18. I built it up to €130ish then this happened.

UTG: Shoves with 80ish
+1: Takes around 2 minutes then calls.
Me: I snap shove hoping to push away +1 since he took forever to call but also was hoping he would call and would be on a draw.
+1: Takes another 2 minutes and finally calls.

Turn: 5x

UTG: Turns over J9
I got extremely relived and turned my J9 and we both got happy that it was a slip pot. 

+1 still hasn’t done anything. Then as the dealer goes to start splitting the pot, +1 says, wait.

SLOWLY turns over his cards, only showing one 10, looks at me and smiles, slides his top card over to reveal the other 10 for the nuts.

The entire table, including the dealer, were shocked. Never, have I EVER wanted to actually slap somebody at the table but last night it almost happened. If you slow roll people on purpose, you should be asked to leave. Fuck."

poker,Summary of the Postle Complaint,"*Intro - What Is This?*

Here's a  summary of the complaint filed against Postle, Kuraitis, and Stones for non-lawyers, in which I attempt to answer many of the questions and issues I've seen tossed around. I'm not revisiting all the facts, I'm assuming if you're reading this you're interested because you know them. If not, take a look at any of Joey Ingram's many podcasts on this issue, Doug Polk's, Matt Berkey's or Jonathan Little's. The Mouthpiece podcast also did a two part interview with Postle. In order to be perfectly clear: the below is a summary of what is presented in the complaint and alleged there, and my own personal opinions on the legal issues involved. I make no statement as to whether those allegations are true.

*The Lawyers - Who's Running This Thing?*

The complaint was filed by several lawyers, each of whom appear to be experienced in gaming law and particularly in poker. The complaint was filed in federal court rather than the state courts of California. There is also a California lawyer who signed on, as California is one of the states which require a local lawyer to appear with counsel who are from other states. Likely the heavy lifting in the case will be done by the Verstandig firm, as Mac Verstandig has a great deal of litigation and gaming law experience. None of this is unusual in any way.

*The Parties - Who's Suing Who?*

There are twenty-five plaintiffs, all of whom appear to have played on the livestream. Veronica Brill is one of the named plaintiffs, and has a unique claim for libel, applied only to Stones. There are three named defendants, Stones Gambling Hall, Justin Kuraitis and Mike Postle. There are twenty unnamed defendants (ten ""John Does"" and ten ""Jane Does"", each of whom is a stand-in for persons or companies (legally also persons, go figure) who were part of the alleged cheating scheme. These Does can be filled in later if, during the course of the discovery process, the plaintiffs find out that there are more or other people involved.

The plaintiffs expressly state that they suspect the identity of one of the Does enough to identify him, but are holding off due to the ""sensitivity of making such an allegation."" They also state that they have directed a litigation hold to that person, which means they have warned him not to destroy any relevant documents. Were such documents to be destroyed (this is called ""spoliation"") the result would be that the jury in a trial would likely be allowed to assume the contents were bad for John Doe 1, and, possibly, the other defendants. I would expect similar letters have already been sent to the other defendants as well.

*Jurisdiction and Venue- Why Is This in Federal Court in California?*

The case is taking place in federal court in California. It was filed there, instead of state court, because the claims include a civil claim under the RICO (Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization) Act. This means that the court also has jurisdiction over the other claims, which would normally be state only claims. As a result, there's one case in the federal court which handles all the issues. There are many reasons to be in federal court rather than state court, but to keep it brief I will say many lawyers prefer their cases as plaintiffs to be in federal court, and the RICO claim permits it to be brought there. Unlike state courts, which must take any case they can (courts of general jurisdiction) the federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and can take only those cases which they are required to take. In this case, the RICO action brings it to federal court, and what is called supplemental jurisdiction brings the other claims along for the ride. The plaintiffs have also indicated that the case should be in federal court because they are seeking more than $5 million, but it's unlikely to matter since they're DOING THE RICO, as they say. As to why California, that is simple, it's where Postle and Stones are, and most importantly it's where everything happened.

*The Facts Pled - What Do the Plaintiffs Say Happened?*

The alleged facts pled include that Mike Postle, on a number of specific dates, received transmissions on his electronic device of hole card information, and that he used that information to cheat the other players on the livestream. In addition, the complaint alleges that Stones ran an insecure broadcast facility, and, when faced with Brill's suspicions about cheating, failed to investigate adequately and then accused her of fabrication. Kuraitis is included as the employee of Stones in charge of the broadcast and the nominal investigation, and in his individual capacity. Included are: Postle's very high win rate, the presentation of Postle as a deity, failure to securely monitor the broadcast hardware to prevent cheating, helping hide Postle's cheating, helping or permitting hold card information to be sent to Postle's device, Postle winning in more than 94% of his livestreamed sessions, the statistical unlikelihood of that happening, and Postle's dedication to playing almost solely in a forum where he had an advantage (didn't play other games), Postle's apparent real time knowledge of facts known only to someone with access to the stream (such as two cards v. four in Omaha, and technical malfunctions (unread RFID cards) ). They also allege that there was a coverup, including ""corrected"" hole cards, Kuraitis' cover (he's just that good), and insufficient investigation once Brill put up the flag for cheating.

Interestingly, they specifically plead that Postle had assistance from one or more people who sent him the information. I was a little surprised by this, since there would seem to be at least some possibility that Postle had access to the back end software and set up his own pipe for himself, since the security seems to have been pretty lax, but there may be information that we haven't seen yet. Regardless, if it turns out to be otherwise, they can always amend (edit) the complaint to conform to whatever they find out. The purpose of the initial complaint is typically just to put the defendants on notice of what they are accused. This complaint has higher requirements because it contains allegations of fraud, which change the rules to require more facts. Once you accuse someone of fraud, you must explain more of the facts that in a basic civil dispute.

*Damages - How Much Are They Asking For?*

The Plaintiffs are asking for roughly $250,000 in compensatory damages (technically they are asking for the actual amounts lost). Compensatory damages are meant to make the plaintiff whole for the amounts lost. This is the amount alleged to have been actually lost by the players who played Postle while he had access to hole card information. They are also asking to have that amount trebled to $750,000 under their RICO claim. If successful on the RICO claim, they are also asking for their attorney's fees. At present, the RICO claim is only against Postle and the unknowns, not Kuraitis or Stones. That could change. The same amount (without trebling) is sought from Stones and Kuraitis as well under the other counts, which are not subject to trebling. They are also seeking to recover $10 million from all of the defendants in punitive damages, to be distributed among the plaintiffs based on the amount of time they played at Stones. Punitive damages are intended, as the name suggests, to punish the defendants for their behavior and to disincentivize others from similar behavior. Uniquely for Brill, they are asking for $1,000 for libel specifically against Stones, and neither of the others, for the ""fabricated"" comment.

*The Counts - What Are the Legal Claims?*

There are nine separate counts. These are the descriptions of the legal claims which could result in a finding of liability for any of the defendants. In this case, the counts are: 1) RICO (Postle and the Does), 2) Fraud (Postle and the Does), 3) Negligent Misrepresentation (all defendants), 4) Negligence Per Se (Postle and the Does), 5) Unjust Enrichment (Postle), 6)  Negligence (Stones and Kuraitis), 7) Constructive Fraud (Stones), 8) Fraud (Stones and Kuraitis) and 9) Libel (Stones).

These are each important for different reasons. The RICO claim permits the case to be brought in federal court, permits the trebling of the loss, and permits the plaintiffs to seek their attorney's fees. This is brought only against Postle and the Does, though. (Again, this could change). The RICO claim does not, however, permit any punitive damages, which are the real teeth of this complaint.

The first Fraud claim essentially states that Postle and the Does held themselves out to be playing a fair game of poker, but were cheating. This claim permits the plaintiffs to seek their losses (but not tripled) and, importantly, punitive damages, which they are currently asking for in the amount of $10 million.

The Negligent Misrepresentation claim addresses the coverup, and the statements by Kuraitis and Stones that the game was fair and that there was no cheating. This claim permits recovery of actual damages, but not punitives.

The Negligence Per Se claim states that Postle broke the wire fraud law, and that the result was losses to the plaintiffs. This claim permits actual damages only.

The Unjust Enrichment count states, quite simply, that it was unfair for Postle to win in the circumstances, and he should be forced to give the money back.

The Negligence count says that Kuraitis and Stones had a duty to run a fair game, but let cheating happen on their watch. This permits recovery of actual damages.

The Constructive Fraud count claims that Stones is constructively responsible for the cheating as it happened in their room, they did not supervise to prevent, and actively assisted in a coverup. This count permits compensatory and punitive damages. Critically, this count (if it sticks) would put Stones on the hook for any punitive damages.

The second Fraud count alleges specifically that Stones and Kuraitis misled the players as to the fairness of the game, which caused them to keep playing. This count would put both Stones and Kuraitis on the hook for any punitive damages.

The final count is a libel count, which states that Stones called Brill's accusations ""fabricated"" when it knew that not to be the case. The only amount sought for this is $1,000.

*Impact of the Counts*

In summary, the critical points from the counts are as follows:

Under all of the counts, the defendants could be held liable for the actual amounts lost, or roughly $250,000.

Under RICO, Postle and the Does could be held liable for triple the actual amounts lost, or roughly $750,000, and could be responsible for the attorney's fees of the plaintiffs.

Under the fraud and constructive fraud claims, the defendants could be held liable for punitive damages. Punitive damages are usually determined based on the need to punish defendants who have been found to have acted grossly negligently or intentionally. The defendant's financial worth and overall situation are taken into account. It seems to me unlikely that Postle or Kuraitis would get hit with $10 million there, but Stones certainly could be profitable enough to be hit with that, if the fraud or the constructive fraud counts stick.

While the damages do add across types (compensatory and punitive), they do not add across counts. In other words, the total that could be awarded would be:

Compensatory (Everyone) ($250,000) + Trebling Under RICO (Postle and the Does only) ($500,000 extra) + Attorney's Fees (Postle and the Does only) (?) + Punitives (Everyone) ($10,000,000) for a total of $10,750,000 plus fees, of which fees and half a million would only be allocable to Postle and the Does.

Note, there's catch-all language they use which says ""and for such other and further relief as may be just and proper"" which is basically legalese for ""If you really get mad, hand them their hats and hit them for everything."" It usually doesn't result in any additional damages, unless the judge in charge gets really peeved.

*Trivia - Typos I Found Funny, or Keeping Sane*

The lawyers typoed principle place of business for Stones in para 31. They mean principal, which is hysterical, because I am not sure what principles are being followed in that particular place of business. Hopefully only good ones.

There's a typo in para 148 which says ""Kuraitis further informed the Stoned Fraud Victims a thorough investigation..."". They mean Stones, but it's also funny as I have met a few stoned poker players here and there.

*Procedure - So What Happens Next?*

Now that the case is filed, the next steps are getting it served, answers and maybe counterclaims, and then off to the civil litigation races. For service, you generally find the person and hand them a copy, or get them to agree to take one by mail or through their lawyers. For corporations like Stones, you send a copy to their registered agent, which they are legally required to have. Once they get it, they get a period of time to respond, which is usually negotiated to be longer, so I wouldn't expect to see anything for at least 30-45 days. If I were on either side of this thing, I'd also be trying to negotiate a resolution now before a metric ton of money gets spent by either side, particularly where there is as much publicity and interest as there is here."
poker,Lol the key to love poker is value bets,"Seriously, value bet your cat 1 hands. Don’t put yourself in marginal spots and don’t limp. Mix in some cat 3 hands. 3 bet only when you have the goods. Don’t be a calling station and don’t chase. Fairly simple stuff"
poker,Weird spot on the flop. What do you think I should I do here?,"Playing 1-2 at the Vic in London. Fairly early on in the session at a pretty reggy table. Villain in this hand seemed decent enough and was ‘Table Captain’. I had also seen him raise flop bets three times in ~40 minutes.


Villain (£900) MP limps £2  
Hero (£390) BTN raises 89h £10  
SB (£350) calls, villain calls  
Flop 10h2h3h  
SB leads £25, villain raises £85  
Hero raises all-in, SB folds, Villain calls.


My two cents:
Pre-flop I think 89s is a pretty standard raise on the button against a single limp. Maybe I could overlimp, but I think folding is far too tight. Most pre-flop charts would agree with me here. 


OTF the SB leading threw me off a bit. I think he might do this with the baby sets, or maybe top pair with Ah. 1010 should have 3-bet pre-flop. Villain can also raise with tons of worse holdings such as all sets, pair with nut flush draw, a few combo draws (Ah5, Ah4) and worse flushes; all of which may call off my jam.

poker,When Mike Postle First Cheated.,"So I am a professional poker player from the SE.  I also have some experience in creating content and using things like Sony Vegas.

So I was engaged by this whole situation early this week, so I, like many,  have been watching Postle hands all week.

I decided to take all of his videos from 2018, from the very beginning in January, till the end which was Dec 17th, 2018, and cut all footage of his hands and place them on a timeline in Sony Vegas.

I have cut clips from every NLHE session from Jan until July of 2018.    I then ran them at 12x-20x speeds which allowed me to simply view hours and hours of nothing but him playing cards throughout.

I am currently rendering that video timeline for others to see.

As I was cutting, at the end of July 18th 2018 stream, I noticed for the first time in a cut that Mike did not have his phone on the table.  So I stopped.  Went back to the beginning of the stream and he had it on the table.  Went back to middle and it was on the table.  So at 2:01, pretty much dead middle of the stream, Mike sits back and drinks his water, and he puts his phone between his legs.  He then scoots toward table and then looks back at the phone to make sure he can see it.  You can see in the clip that mike has the phone on the chair in between his legs.

I go back to the first session cuts, and start running the video at 12x, through every session from Jan 2018 until that moment.  Not a single moment in 6 months does Mike's body language change, or his phone move off the table.  No hands in his lap, no looking into his lap, no grabbing his head,  until 2:01 on July 18th stream.

I had watched the majority of the streams previous to July 18th and remembered a number of spots Mike called bad on river or bluffed into sets.  For example on a K108x9 flop with like 4 hearts mike called off bad with K9 vs a Jack high flush, and bluffed into a set of 2's in another session.  In every session before July 18th, if you go through you will find a mistake.

In those sessions, previous to July 18th at 2:01 you will also find he never cold calls 3 bets with weak holdings, many times folding decent hands to 3 and 4 bets.  You will even see that he folds to a 3 bet in the July 18th episode before the 2:01 mark.

Before I move on, note his playing frequency.  He played twice in January on back to back days. Doesn't play again till Feb 12th, then again on the 21st.  Doesn't play again until April 19, then another month later on May 23rd, then a month later again in June on the 9th.  Before July, he has 7 sessions in 6 months on live stream. Obviously he is playing somewhere else.

Between July 1 and August 6th, he has 6 sessions in a month vs 7 sessions for the previous 6 months.

In the previous 7 sessions before July 18th at 2:01, he earned $855 on average per session including his PLO sessions.

In the 7 sessions following the July 18th session, he averaged $4000 dollars per session for $27, 750 dollars total.

Going back to sessions.

If you look at the footage on July 18th after the 2:01 mark you will see one of the first cold call 3 bets with 52 offsuit vs KK.  In this hand, Mike makes a blatant look at his phone between his legs after the 3 bettor leads into him.  The board had flopped a 2.  He looked back and saw KK, and folded.

In other sessions right after the July 18th 2:01 mark, you will see the same behavior time after time.  And this same behavior continues for a year and a half.

Once you see all of the pre July 18th 2:01 footage sped up at 12x speeds, the cheating becomes so obvious its unbelievable how clear it is.

The hand analysis of hands pre July 18th and post July 18th 100% back up the physical tell / change he makes to his entire poker game, the increased frequency of playing also confirms a change on July 18th, his winnings back up a change on July 18th after the 2:01 mark.  On July 18th at 2:01, you can literally watch GOD be born. His cold calling 3bet frequency increases, his soul reads in general are never the same again.

&amp;#x200B;

With the evidence of the the hand analysis, him telling people who's cards are not reading they need to fix their cards as Joey Ingram streamed tonight, and the other mountain of evidence, the only thing that was missing was when and how.

Well to prove he cheated, and how he cheated, you first must figure out when he cheated.  To figure out when he cheated, you must figure out when he didn't cheat.  Mike Postle didn't cheat before July 18th mid way through stream, and you can see in that moment him start his cheat.

&amp;#x200B;

I also believe, though I have not went through it, that if you follow through from that point, that you will see his cheating evolve from having the phone in his lap and arms on the table, to keeping an arm down there.  I believe this was to keep the phone active due to it going to silent or locking.  He then goes away from his looking straight down, as he does on July 18th, to later his patent turn my head straight down with my hat forward and don't mind me I'm just checking my hole cards.  I think you will also see that not too long after the July 18th episode and a few episodes after, Mike moves almost exclusively to the 2 seat for obvious reasons.

Once I have a video complete, I will share some of these examples I have used here to show mistakes before July 18th and some of the most blatant physical tells he is looking at his phone during the most insane situations after the 18th session.

I have held out the potential for this man to somehow to have not cheated, but once you see when it starts, it's as clear as day what is going on. He cheated.

Why is it always the douchey looking sunglass wearing hipsters doing this in mid stakes MTT like they think they are Phil fucking Ivey. Turbo tournament where average stacks is 20bb and they do this.
poker,Hypothetical Postle Question,"Imagine if you are playing at stones vs Postle, before the whole scandal was uncovered, and you're the only one that just knew for sure he's cheating, and exactly how he cheats. (ie. he knows hole cards but not cards that are to come) Also assume Postle never figures out that you know and keeps doing what he does.

Do you think it's possible to beat him?

Postle will be playing an unbalanced strategy. He will be over bluffing when you have weak marginal hands, and under bluffing when you have strong hands.

So sure, he knows your cards, but because you know he knows, you can narrow his range down too depending on your hand and in addition, induce him to do stuff.

So some exploits could be:

1. If you have a strong hand, ALWAYS FOLD to his LARGE bets, since you would normally call/raise so he has you coolered.
2. If you have a weak marginal hand, ALWAYS HERO CALL LARGE BETS since you would normally fold here and he is going to overbluff by a lot. If he actually had a good hand, he would probably bet small to make you call.
3. If you have a marginal hand, ALWAYS FOLD TO SMALL MILKING BETS since he thinks you would normally call, so he has you beat. If he is bluffing, he would bet much larger, knowing your holding.
4. If you have a weak hand on the flop, and he doesn't take stabs, but as you pick up good cards, he starts betting, ASSUME HE WAS TRAPPING YOU
5. Never bluff/value bet on the river without the nuts

Basically, it's possible to exploit him by doing the opposite of what you would do in marginal spots, where his exploit of you is so unbalanced that you can reverse exploit him.

Is that enough to be +EV overall, assuming he is Postle and doesn't pick up on it?"

poker,Mike Postle is the reason I work out.,"Mike Postle is the reason I work out. I have this fantasy where we start talking at the Stone's Casino bar. We exchange a few pleasantries. He asks what I do. I say I loved him in the live stream. He laughs. I get my whiskey. ""Well, see ya,"" I say and walk away. I've got his attention now. How many guys voluntarily leave a conversation with Mike Postle? He touches his neck as he watches me leave. Later, as the night's dragged on and the coterie of gorgeous narcissists grows increasingly loose, he finds me on the balcony, my bowtie undone, smoking a cigarette. ""Got a spare?"" he asks. ""What's in it for me?"" I say as I hand him one of my little white ladies. he smiles. ""Conversation with me, duh."" I laugh. ""What's so funny?"" he protests. ""Nothing, nothing... It's just... don't you grow tired of the soul reads?"" ""You get used to it,"" he says, lighting his cigarette and handing me back the lighter. ""What would you do if you weren't God?"" I ask. ""Teaching, I think."" ""And if I was your student, what would I be learning?"" ""Discipline,"" he says quickly, looking up into my eyes, before changing the subject. ""Where are you from?"" ""Bermuda,"" I say. ""Oh wow. That's lovely."" ""It's ok,"" I admit. ""Not everything is to my liking."" ""What could possibly be not to your liking in Bermuda?"" he inquires. ""I don't like sand,"" I tell him. ""It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere."""
poker,Countering a Limped range strategy,"I was playing with a player today that would limp call his entire range of hands, regardless of position. 

It made it very difficult to range him, as he would limp call K7s UTG and then also limp call AK, and plenty in between (J4s, 67o, 25s, etc). 

I never saw him show down any pocket pairs TT+ so not sure if he employed this strategy with high PP's as well, but for discussion's sake lets say he limp calls his entire range. 

What is the best way to exploit this?

Should I be value betting more thinly? Expanding my preflop raising range? Tightening my range and reducing my bluffing frequency?

He would call flop Cbets &amp; turn bets pretty frequently, and then either give up or put in big raises IP or check-raises OOP. I would typically assume he got there and give up with the middle-bottom of my range. 

Here's one hand in particular that I'm not sure if I should have given up early on or called down.

I have about 400 and he covers with ~1k. Game is 1/3.

There is a straddle on the button for 6, SB calls, he calls in the BB, folds to me in MP with AdTh.

I raise to 30 and only he calls. 

Flop is Tx5d2x, i bet 30 and he flats.

Turn is 2d, i bet 35 and he check raises to 75. 

He might be attacking my small sizing but I really haven't seen him bluff with draws (or really anything), typically just calling until he gets there or bricks. 

He could really have any 2 here so perhaps this was the spot to give up or get it in. As played, I call. 

River is the 8d, so the board is: Tx5d2x2d8d

He leads for 100 and I end up folding. 

It was difficult for me to range him here and I felt like I played this terribly as a result. 

Thoughts on the specific hand as well as how to effectively counter a limp-heavy preflop strategy would be great!"
poker,Need help checking understanding.,"Hi folks, I'm starting to try to review hands away from the table to get a bit better. I just want to double check my understanding of underlying maths...

The following assumes two players playing optimally:

Where player 1 bets half pot, player 2 should defend with at least 67% of their range.

According to pot odds, player 2's defense will be +ev if they have at least 25% equity.

Therefore, player 1's raising range should be the range that gives them at least 75% equity vs 67% of player 2's range.

Is that correct?"

poker,"My experience with Run It Once *POKER* site, (not the training site)","So I embarked on an adventure to go and try out RIO (run it once) poker.. https://www.runitonce.eu/ as I was done with stars and there ethics.

My friends were being offered challenges on stars which if they raked enough they'd be making 40% rakeback, I contacted support and asked where mine was but they would not give it to me so that was it, I headed out to Run It Once.

At first I was optimistic, I took about a 4k roll and was playing 50 PLO. Initially I was annoyed because there was no games starting and the traffic is really poor.

I was taken in by the whole '51%' rakeback guaranteed. Now this is the tricky part, their '51%' rakeback is actually a 'splash' pot which increases variance and I'm not sure how long it would actually take for you to be able to win your 51% rakeback and how much deviation is involved considering people just go all in when it's a big splash pot with Any Two Cards basically.

I then looked into the 'StreamR' option which means you can get 50% 'effective' rakeback if you get 200 watch hours. Basically effective rakeback means that RIO will take any promotions or bonuses they run off your streaming pay. So if you rake $100 you might end up with about $25 at the end if you had 100% rakeback. So seeing this, I set up my stream and started streaming

It took me a long time to hit 200 watch hours and all this time I was sitting and waiting for games for hours on end which you can see on my stream.

How soft are games:

Well, here's the thing, I thought the games would be very beatable with 51% splash and 50% effective rakeback but most of the games I played had 5 regs, it was very rare I saw a genuine fish in the games.

'quote from statname'

It is the correct table selection with the opponents we want to see at our tables. It is quite obvious: the more you want to win, the more someone has to lose at your table (in poker, just as anywhere else, money is not made “out of thin air”).

So, we are going to talk about modern methods of table selection, key factors of which are math and software technology.

If table selection increases profits, ignoring it is clearly –EV and simply unprofessional. In today's world, table selection should be given no less attention than working on your game.

How regulars usually approach table selection?

Play any table with any fish player;
Play any table with a fish player that has VPIP of 40+;
Play any table with a fish player that has a winrate of -40bb/100 and worse
Let's take the 3rd option as an example (it is the best of all 3) and assess the winrate regular can hope for, selecting tables with a fish player that has a winrate of -40bb/100 and worse.

Let’s say you are an average 50NL regular. The rake would be around 8bb/100 at this stake (even higher for PLO). It means you have a negative winrate of -8bb/100 right from the moment you joined the table, so you need some positive factors, which can compensate for the rake and give you some more to make profit eventually.


I thought given I was getting 51% splash pots and 50% effective rakeback I would be making a killing on this site, also while being able to help back an ethical poker site run by a poker player.


Well, I hit 200 hours, and I had to wait till the 8th of the next month to receive my streamer payment. After I received my streamer payment I noticed 300 euros was missing. I reached out to Phil and the 'team' to wonder where this money had gone.

They told me that the 'First deposit bonus' that I had to wager to get was taken off my streamR pay. I really didn't expect this to happen as I just thought it was promotional bonuses which were taken off the streamR promotion.

You can say this is my fault for not completely understanding and asking about the ToS and I admit I could of. But I think doing this is shady and unethical from Phil Galfond and his team.

A first deposit bonus should be a bonus and incentive on it's own, not something you can deduct from people who are trying to grow your site.

Pros of playing on RIO:

Anon tables, if you're a fish this is probably good for you.

Cons of playing on RIO:

No traffic,
Buggy software, at least 10+ bugs atm,
Games crashing,
People randomly being taken for their bb on all their tables,
REG HEAVY GAMES, this is the main one, like I talked about before, you need someone to be donating enough money for you to be beating the games that's just a fact.

Also to touch on the StreamR promotion, if you go to RIO and you stream for 200 hours watch time expecting to be rich after...

If you have deposit bonus, even if you earned '300 euros' in rakeback that you expect to get from streaming all these hours, you're actually going to make 0 euros at the end if you have 300 wagered from your deposit bonus.

So imagine you raked enough to make 300 euros from the 50% eff rakeback and it was all taken because you had a deposit bonus. This is how it works.

In my opinion it's pretty unethical and I won't be touching RIO again. You can argue that it's 'in the TOS' but why would anyone stream for this many hours if at the end RIO i just going to take your deposit bonus back from what you earned anyway.

This means if you plan on being a level 1 streamer at RIO and streaming for 200 watch hours and 50% eff rakeback, you would have to pay enough rake to clear your deposit bonus which is up to 600 euros AND on top of that have to rake A LOT of money to be able to see any money from the StreamR promotion at all.

I'm making this post so people don't make the same mistake as I did, the games aren't soft and the rakeback is mainly in splash pots or they write the TOS in a certain way which means you're being f*cked basically.

You could be wondering why I think the games are so tough on RIO compared to other sites. Well here I will post my pokerstars results and then I will post my RIO results and you can decide, I have also spoke to many other streamers who agree they are not beating the site because rake is high and the rakeback is not what it seems.

here is my stars graph 

https://gyazo.com/939b2145b2263938d340b746393767e5

and here is my RIO graph

https://gyazo.com/072a81029270c330848fe6d010fd8310

I contacted RIO and asked for my 300 euros back which I feel like was deceivingly taken from me but they would not so that's why I feel I'm entitled to warn people now.

I also have to say how good of a job GG poker is doing and why there is literally 0 reason you would want to play on Run It Once instead.

https://www.nsusaff.com/streamers

here, if you stream on GG poker and hit 10k watch hours you will be paid 5k which your deposit bonus WONT be deducted (afaik don't quote me on this)

GG poker and running weekly 100k rake races.

and they are doing splash pots  WITH RAKEBACK.

so on GGpoker you can play with SPLASH pots AND rakeback, where as on run it once all they have is splash pots.

This isn't a shill for GGpoker anyway,

I also advise people to play on pokerstars instead of run it once as the games are actually beatable because there is fish on the site, even if you aren't getting much rakeback.

Anyway, I'm going back to pokerstars to grind my roll back up after I feel like I was deceived by RIO with all the pretty '100%' rakeback blah blah

just remember, the '51%' rakeback they give is in a reg filled structure and they RAKE the splash pots.

yeah, f*ck ur 'ethical poker site' phil, you're no better than the rest.

If you want to give me my 300 euros deposit bonus which I know you 'legally took' but deceived from me after I streamed your reg heavy site with high rakeback for so many hours then hit me up. But you're ignoring my discord messages so."

poker,Avoiding Spew on Bovada,"Alright so this is something between a rant and an ask for help.

I got into poker about 6 months ago and have been intrigued ever since. I’ve been binge watching lot’s of $1/$2 cash game grinder vlogs, a lot of rudimentary tutorials, and I’m currently reading  “The Mathematics of Poker” by Bill Chen. I understand exactly what it takes to be a winning player (as I’m sure most of this sub does), but I’ve yet to make a big enough change in my discipline to become a winning player.

In total, I‘ve donated about $250 in the last 6 months to Bovada tables. Granted, the first $150 or so came when I had absolutely no business playing online poker. I have noticed I have a habit of loading my account with $25, making it last 1-2 weeks, and repeating. I typically start hot, get my balance to near double, then immediately spew. I’ve noticed that Bovada GUI, while aesthetically pleasing, lulls players into a sense of complacency.

I don’t want to play Bovada anymore. I don’t know that I should be playing online at all. Any recommendations for books/videos on bankroll management as well as for sites that I can play from the states **that provides player information** would be fantastic."

poker,How to get better at higher levels in tournaments,"This is my first post on this sub.

I just got eliminated whilest playing a $4.50 sit &amp; go on pokerstars with about 70 players after the registration period ended. In this format you start with $1500 in chips with 10/20 blinds and a 3 ante on level 1. Every 10 minutes the blinds go up. I finished in 23rd place, which is 9 spots off of the money.

I think I played pretty well in the early levels of the game, as I became the chip leader very quickly and held on to that lead for almost the entire game. 

Around level 11, where the blinds are 400/800 with a 75 ante, I managed to lose my huge lead which eventually led to my downfall. I think I got eliminated because I don't know what a good range is to play on in later levels (and losing some unlucky flips).

poker,A hand I played against Mike Postle,"5/10/20 at you-know where.

I am UTG+1 with **7s8s**. Mike is to my left. UTG straddles to $20 and I decide to mix it up and raise to $100. Fold to SB who makes it $280 and BB 4bets to $750. I think this is a clear call for me given my position and stack size (which I didn't know, but it was big). I call and Mike calls, and so does BB.

**Flop: 6s Ac 4s.** 3k pot

SB checks, BB immedialely goes all-in for 3k more. I don't think there's too much of a decision here: I call and so does mike. SB folds.

**Turn: 6s Ac 4s Jd** 6k 12k pot

I have about 6k left, so I check, hoping to get a free card. Mike bets $2k and, with the flush and gutshot on board, I have no choice but to call.

**River: 6s Ac 4s Jd 5s.** 16k pot

Wa-wa-weeza! I shove all-in for my remaining 4k. Mike thinks for a while, he keeps thinking, he thinks, he thinks, he uses his GOD poker skills and then folds his hand, face up: he has **2s3s.** ""I know I'm not good,"" he says.I show my hand and everyone gasps at how GODLY mike is. ""What a fold"" one guy says. ""This guy is a god!"" Yes, of course, indeed he is.

""I should have looked at my dick earlier,"" Mike says. ""Would have saved me some cash.""

I crushed him and am proud of it. I collect a massive pot and thank him for his fair play and unrelenting devotion to a fair and honest game."
poker,How to improve hand reading?,"Ok,so I had yesterday one of those sessions being card dead,with few playable hands,with stealing opportunities in late position being complicated due to a reg on my left (however table was okish since there was few weak regs and a whale punting despite him having a stretch of run good calling three barrels with gutshots and getting there or rivering two pairs with Jrag vs reg AJ)

After nitting it up,I had two spots where I could get away and want to see what you guys think what was the best moment two hero fold/bet?

1-1
Weak UTG+1 (~120) opens to 6, Reg calls (~200+),me nit BB (~120) 88,call.

Closing the action,implied odds if hitting set,don't want to bloat pot since probably i don't have fold equity despite being quiet for few orbits unless i make it to a ridiculous price  (weak UTG is sticky pre and reg is capable of 4B light,5betting shoving 78s vs whale and cracking his ""I had aces"")

Flop (~19) T83r
I check,UTG+1 cbets 8,BU calls,I raise to 35,UTG+1 calls BU folds.

At this point I think UTG+1 range is mainly overpairs,Tx good kickers,or two overcards.

Turn (~97) Ko
I check,V checks.

I could probably keep betting instead of checking, right?I thought it was a good card for him to barrel and extract value that way.

River (~97) A
I bet ~40,V shoves I call.

I doubted that he called flop raise with QJ,so I thought i had the best hand a certain amount of the time,(beating AT AK,KT..)
However V had TT.
Cooler?or could get away with it by defining his range with a turn bet?or could easily fold river raise?


Anyway,reload,card dead,and after a few orbits new player sits where one of the weak regs was.

1-1
Whale straddle 2,weak reg MP limps,new guy limps (~150) BU limps,me nit SB (~120) call 1 with K9cc,BB reg calls,straddle checks.

Flop (~12) QT5 all clubs
Checks to the new guy who bets 10,I call,heads up to the turn.

I was on my B- tilt mode due to not getting cards,whiffing flops when I did,or getting non believers in steal spots that I didn't really thought about what could be his range,something like ""ok this is it,whatever he has this is the hand to getting it in,if he has AXc fuck it,whatever""but probably having the best hand here

Turn (~32) 3c
Check,check.

Killing action card sort of,I am kind of face up in a flushdraw and just got there if i was,and when I called flop something in me wanted to believe that V could have pair+flushdraw kind of thing that I beat.When he checks I am convinced that I had the best hand.

River (~32) Q
I bet 25,V min clicks 50 I shove for a bit more

I didn't even noticed that now there were boats in his range,but on the turn I was 100% not folding any rivers.
So yeah V QTo.

Should I better be raising flop in here?betting turn?fold river?

If I get any outcome out of all of this is don't slowplay big made hands out of position,and respect river raises."

poker,Are there are any secrets to playing in a Bomb Pot?,"I will preface this by saying I am definitely not a pro and, frankly, I don't get all the pot odds mathematical stuff.  I play poker for fun.  So, yea, I am a fish.  I lose more than I win and all I care about really is having a good time with other people for my money.

The other night I was playing at a 2/5 table and someone said lets do a bomb pot.  Before I could even say ""I have no fucking idea what a 'bomb pot' is,"" everyone was throwing in $25.  I said I would play but people would have to explain what it was to me because I honestly had no idea.  Some folks thought I was screwing around but most who have played with me before understood and were kind enough to explain how it works.  So, this was my hand:

I was dealt AcQd.  Obviously there were no pre-flop bets and the flop came up Qs5c6d.  I was actually first to act and had literally no idea what to do because there were 8 total people who saw the flop.  So I bet $250 into a pot that was $200.  Everyone promptly folded to me and I won my first Bomb Pot.  I bought everyone a drink because I am a sucker.

Anyway, now I would honestly like any feedback if I played that hand the right way.  I have no idea what I was doing.  I do know that anyone at the table who had a table read on me would probably consider me one step away from what all of you affectionately call an OMC.  Thank you for any feedback, I appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:  Thanks to everyone for the helpful feedback.  I really appreciated it.  I have learned two things:  1) me winning my first bomb pot was essentially luck and 2) that letter I sent to my managing partner telling him to go fuck himself because this 54 year-old was quitting to become a professional poker player was probably a huge mistake....**"

poker,"I just need to vent, and maybe some advice would be nice. Here’s two stupid/stupid crazy hands I played","So I play in this weekly ten dollar tournament, 5-10k stack, at my local small casino, I’m pretty new to the game so that’s all I’m willing to put down for now. 

So this first hand is the most recent one and fresh in my mind. 

Seven handed, 25/50, half hour in, I have A9 of diamonds and limp in from early position 

Flop comes KQJ with two diamonds 

Checks to me and I lead out for 1k, I have maybe 8-9k (I bought in for the minimum). People really like to call and are pretty aggressive here so I thought it was the right play. Player on my left calls and everyone else folds, sweet.

Turns a brick

I now bet 2k and he raises to 4 

Now here’s the thing, I called. I can’t really tell if if it was the right play here, it’s gotta be around 50/50 in the long term, I had, from my calculations 13-16 outs with around 3 to 1 pot odds? And how would that be different if I checked? (which I wish I did). I was pretty short stacked too relative to most of the table who bought in for twenty. 

Anyway river’s another brick, I check he bets 1k and I fold face up for sympathy.

Man I wish I had checked the turn, I might have had enough to get my semi bluff shove through that knocked me out in a very similar position a few orbits later (dude had a pair of fours but the price was too good he said). I mean it was at best a 50-50 call and I shouldn’t have even been so brash on such a wet board so short stacked. Live and learn I guess. 

Second Hand:

Week before I had K3 on the button, long story short flop comes AQJ this girl bets a large amount, folds everybody out, I call out of hope and suspicion. Turns another ace, she bets bigger and I really don’t believe her. She obviously doesn’t have an ace or straight or she wouldn’t fold everybody out of the hand like that. I call

River’s a brick and she bets some ridiculous amount and I tank. I just KNOW she doesn’t have anything close to the nuts, and she knows I don’t either, but I just have king high, could be the relative nuts in this situation but ANY pair beats me. 

So eventually I justI folded and she asked if I wanted her to show, of course I did, she turns over T8 or some BS and I tilted all my chips away after that, haven’t stopped thinking about it since. 

Basically I’m at the weird point where either I know I should call or could bluff but don’t out of fear, and I call and over bluff when I know I shouldn’t and basically start to gamble due to some kind of tilt or sunken cost thing or just dumb hope. Every time I learn a little more but it’s going slow, not much anyone can tell me I think but I just wanted to vent and maybe someone can relate that’s going through the same sort of thing now and can feel better about it, or maybe one of you can tell me they got through it and I’ll feel better lol.

EDIT: 
Thanks everybody for the advice, but it seems some things weren’t clear, or I thought you would put it together. 

In the first hand I know I should raise most of the time but I’m out of position at an aggressive table with only an ok hand, also I have well over 100 big blinds but was still short stacked due to my buy in amount and was planning on calling a reasonable raise anyway.

 Also everybody else did limp in, by saying I “limped in from early position” I meant that’s what I did and that’s all that I did, I paid a bb to see a flop. Also I didn’t mention how many people were in the hand because I don’t remember the exact number and I didn’t feel like it mattered because I folded everyone out but one on the flop.

As for my raise size on the flop, I know it was big but people are pretty reckless there and don’t fold easily, 3,4 or even 5x raise would have been risky and I wanted to get heads up or get everyone to fold. 

For the second hand the point was just that I had a perfect read in this very scary situation and and  gave into the fear, that’s all. can’t tell you why I got into that situation in the first place, I was on the button and it must have been like a min raise pre flop or even just a bunch of limpers.

poker,Jnandez PLO mastermind is inapplicable to live low stakes PLO. Any alternatives?,"Going through the Jnandez PLO mastermind and the first two hours, I’m just constantly going through commentary talking about things like: 

a) folding KQT9s in SB vs BTN open when rake is high 
b) opening AKQ8ddds UTG to steal blinds if players in the middle are tight 

and a lot of such things that just don’t apply to live 1/2-1/3-2/5 PLO where almost everyone plays almost every hand.

poker,Optimal Preflop and C-Betting Strategies vs. Limpers and Calling Stations,"Hi r/Poker!

I'm new to the game and would like to seek some advice on how to improve my strategy at a weekly tournament at a local casino. I've been fascinated by the theory behind the game especially the data and simulation-based approach to poker that we've seen more of in the last decade and would be grateful for any comments on how I'm approaching the game from this perspective.

**The Opponents**

The tournament field (around 20-40 each week) is largely comprised of 'weaker' regular players.

*Preflop*: The majority love to open limp from all positions . At the moment, I've profiled [4 types of open-limp/overlimp ranges](https://imgur.com/a/FvVr1YQ) which are largely invariable across positions. The overall tendency is toward being passive. Lines like three-betting and limp-raising are highly unlikely.

*Post-flop*: It is not uncommon to see flops three, four and five handed. Though tendencies vary, many lean toward being overly station-y postflop and generally inelastic. I've had many of my big draw barrelling hands called down with hands like top pair weak kicker. Again, the overall tendency is toward being passive, lots of calling. Semi-bluff check-raises and flop 3-bets are very rare, and when they occur almost invariable indicate a very strong hand.

**My Thinking**

My general approach at the moment is to focus on playing [tighter ranges if I raise first in](https://imgur.com/a/ZGAFogJ) following the rule of 3BB+1BB per limper. In late position when it is not uncommon be faced with two or three limpers, I iso-raise large with my strongest holdings (AKo+, TT+) and just over-limp hands that can flop strong enough hands to play multiway (e.g. baby pocket pairs, stronger suited connectors and suited Ax).

**Question 1:** is this a winning strategy overall? Are the ranges sensible?

**C-Betting** This is where I would benefit most from advice. From what I understand, though out of position, given the strength of our early position range, we can C-bet at a high frequency on certain textures. Take for instance a board like A72 rainbow. Would [this](https://imgur.com/a/iGSTSEu) combination of checks (green) and bets (blue) be okay facing say, 2 opponents, or is this incorrect?

Where I struggle are boards like Q10s7s or Js9s8 having raised from MP (say if I'm sandwiched between BB and Button). What should our overall betting strategy be like for our [entire range](https://i.imgur.com/2G5PC36.png)?"

PS don't offer Rakeback whereas PP do - But I'm not sure how to factor that in - I *think* for every $25 I take from Pots I can get back $5 and appears to cost me $2.50 in Rake? Doesn't seem right.

Can anyone advise me better?

poker,SMFC definitely meant show me four cards - maybe?,"At least in Mike and Justins head.

This is the 3 game mix everyone has probably seen the clip  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBTJkgd7YsQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBTJkgd7YsQ)

If we look at the start of the stream mike is actually not registered to play (7:36 - 8:57). Then at (27:10) youtube user Tim Ferris comments SMFC = so many freakin chips, Justin then addresses this comment (28:33) and says i think you might be right etc, indicating he's not sure what it means.  

I believe someone else probably registered mike as SMFC. If we now skip forward to (4:29:55) when mike enters the booth he starts talking about the PLO hand with the 2/4 cards. Now at (4:31:28) barely a minute later the chip count graphic comes up and mike genuinely surprised - sees his name as SMFC for the first time and says - ""You like my name tonight; SMFC? I didnt know that was my name but... ""I guess i was sending out messages tonight and I didnt even know?""

Now this is where the community half fucks up. We collectively conclude that SMFC means show me four cards. But we assumed when he says said ""sending messages"" he meant ""text messages"" because we had the whole phone situation on our collective minds. 

What I believe he actually meant was sending out messages in a telepathic universal sense to someone, ie Justin. 

Now the only reason the community was able to come up with the conclusion SMFC meant show me four cards is because we were armed with the knowledge that Mike was cheating. Which means only a person that would get this little reference also had to know he was cheating.  

I mean look how fucking funny the smug fuck finds his whole interaction with kaycee from (4:31:31 - 4:31:54.) Kaycee has no idea wtf he's talking about but he is full laughing his fucking smug ass off. The only reason he would find the acronym so fucking funny is because he also immediatly associated it with SHOW ME FOUR CARDS and he thinks is so fucking funny that hes pulling one over everyone. I mean look at the way he stares into the chat after he asks what does it stand for. Its the same fucking face he pulls every time hes about to pull some crazy move when he robs someone. He cannot control that shit.

poker,EV for Flop CBet of 65% Against Maniac,"I’m trying to figure out the EV equation for this situation. I had TPTK and cbet 65% and a maniac called and hit a 2-pair on the turn.
100 pot on the flop (Q58dd) and remaining stack 200 behind. I cbet 65 and player calls with 52o.
Is it like this:

```
From his point of view:
.9*-65 = -58.5
.1*365 = 36.5
So for him, calling the 65 is a -22 play.

What if the bet was higher, like 75?
.9*-75=-67.5
.1*365=36.5
EV -31

poker,Are jackpot tournaments viable?,"How bad is a jackpot tournament where 33% goes into a jackpot for the winner?

I rarely play live but I have nothing I need to do tonight and nothing on tomorrow so was excited for an opportunity to play a rare live tournament.

The best tournament rake of the three casinos in my city is 13%, whereas the other two are more than 20%, so I'm pretty determined to only ever play at the former.

The problem is that tonight the best casino has a jackpot tournament, where it's £34, 20 to prize pool, 10 to jackpot, and 4 rake. There is £1250 guaranteed prize pool and £1250 guaranteed jackpot, with ""a chance"" for the winner to take the jackpot, if not it rolls over. Not sure what it's at tonight or whether it has rolled over, can't find any more information on the website.

Given the variance already involved in shipping any single MTT, and the presumably small to medium chance of taking the jackpot when you do get there, it feels almost like the rake is now 16 on £20. The live tournament fields in my city are hilariously soft, though, and literally the only time I've played a tournament at this casino before I chopped it three way as the chip leader, so I feel I've got a decent chance. 

Is the tournament viable? Should I play one of the 23% rake ones instead (nicer casino and even worse players imo)? Or should I just give up and play cash?

**Edit**: I've since learned that the jackpot is in fact ~£3200 for tonight due to previous rollover, prior to tonight's addition, so will probably go up to something around £4500. The chance of winning is 1 in 9.

So my entry is about 0.22% of the likely jackpot. So I need better than a 0.22% of winning to make it +EV, I think. If I have an 11% chance of winning upon getting 1st place, then I think I need a 2% chance of winning the tournament to make it 0EV? Is my maths horrifically off, here?"

poker,UTG/Early Position Limps,"I play mostly NL 5 and NL20 6-max zoom on Bodog (Bovada) and I have lately been noticing a significant increase in UTG or UTG+1 open limping by players who I would assume are winning/studied players (it’s Bodog, so no HUD or real hand histories, I am basing this on the players having stacks of 3x or 4x the max buy-in).

I’m not a great player, I generally beat NL 5 and then tend to lose slightly at NL20 and drop back down to NL 5. I am studied enough to know that, for sure, open-limping, particularly from early position is not something you’re supposed to do, and that you generally shouldn’t have an open-limping range from any position, least of all UTG.  

Having said that, when I see weird plays I usually try and understand what the strategy is, especially when it would appear the player is better than me.

poker,"Does there need to be a ""smoking gun""?","I've heard suggestions that Postle might get away with it due to the absence of a ""smoking gun"", i.e. actual direct evidence showing him cheating. Is this really necessary, though?

People are convicted of crimes all the time on the basis of strong circumstantial evidence (fingerprints, DNA, etc.); while the law places a high burden of proof on the prosecution, at a certain point we have to accept that this threshold has been met. If your DNA is all over the crime scene and you've got the victim's blood in your car, you're probably going to prison, even though there is a tiny (maybe 1 in a few billion) probability that you're innocent. Why can't this standard apply to analysing cheating in poker? Postle's miraculous winrate over a solid sample size appears, in itself, to be a ""DNA all over the crime scene""-type scenario. Couple this with the extremely suspicious behaviour and the likelihood of consistently winning pots with mathematically terrible preflop play and I don't see how any prosecutor could fail to secure a conviction.

Any legal experts out there who can chime in?

poker,Cheating in Poker,"With everything happening in the poker world right now and after reading the complaint filed yesterday against Postle, the only reason Postle was caught was due to his results. Given, his actions at the table are extremely questionable (always looking down in big decisions and various other weird situations) the only reason these actions were brought to light were due to his unreal winnings over time. This made me stop and wonder, what if Postle had just kept himself within the 5-20 BBs/hour range and not win more than \~70% of his sessions. One could easily do this with the information that Postle was provided. The results would conform to what a pro would earn at those stakes. Albeit his actions are still wonky at the table but there wouldn't be any substantial proof of cheating. So what I am trying to say is, what is stopping other players on other large streams from already doing something similar to this? I am not in any way accusing anyone of cheating but what is stopping someone that has a little bit of inside information and isn't overly greedy like Postle was? This person would easily be able to crush high stakes at the 5-20 bbs/hr and not win more than \~70% of their sessions while completely flying under the radar."
poker,Which poker trip do you think would be most fun or most profitable?,"Assume your roll is in CAD, winning 1/2 and 10NL, occasional shot take at 2/5. Would be rolled for some USD 2/5 but not quite EUR or GBP. 1 month for each trip, goal is to grind but want to have fun along the way


1. West coast road trip, mostly car or tent camping, major stops Seattle/Portland/SanFran/LA/Palm Springs/Vegas


2. NE road trip, mostly cheap-ish hotels in cities, major stops Montreal, Boston, AC, Philly and Maryland


3. Backpacking Western Europe, mostly staying in hostels, spending most of time in London, Barca or Dublin

Advantage of Europe would be with the forex, being able to play “bigger” but at the same stakes. Disadvantage would be flight cost + carrying cash while sleeping in same room as other people. 

Road trip advantage is having a vehicle for storage/privacy, USD isn’t as big of a jump as GBP. Private hotel rooms. Could also end the trip at any given time. Disadvantage would be hotel price + less tourism/outdoor activities if doing NE route"
poker,The Postle Narrative,"I hate how the narrative in Dougs latest video is that he's not guilty. Poker hands are sort of explainable. Don't get me wrong, I think that it would be difficult for a criminal proceeding based off of watching ""fishy hands"". No doubt about that. There is zero explanation for the RFID shenanigans that happened. Postle goes back into the booth afterwards. He stares into the camera asking what happened to the cards being displayed.

I was showing the situation to casual poker fans and they were wondering why they were discussing for so long his innocence."

poker,When to call out questionable behaviour /possible cheating?,"I played my first live table game recently at casino in QLD Australia, $2/4 NLH for about 8 hours.

I observed a number of things but didn’t say anything because I had never played felt, and was not sure of the culture or rules, and was winning anyway. But i want to know what you guys would have done. Which of these should you call out? Maybe i am over reacting and this is just typical behaviour of the drunks/plebs etc?

1. A guy who buys in for about $200 makes a wall of $5 chips about 5 stacks 6 chips high in a semi circle shape, and behind that he placed a few $25 chips, clearly not visible, i only saw because i was in the same side of table as him.

2. lady had stacks of $5, but the stacks toward the back had $25s at the bottom that i didn’t know about until i was in a hand and she raised me. I didn’t say anything and would have folded in this situation regardless but it really made me get up and walk around the table and check the stack. I thought she had $200 but she actually has about $600. She has a messy stack in general that probably wasn’t cleaned up from taking a big pot.

3. A guy has mostly $5 chips. Whenever he went below about $200 he would pull a $100 chip from shirt pocket and place it on table with his stack. If he got his reds back up again to $200 he removed it before next hand started. This continued for hours until on one hand i notice him remove the $100 chip after checking his cards and limping and the action moving to other side of table. He was over $200 in reds so i think it was an honest mistake of not removing the chip before the hand. I had already folded. 

Now the above seems like just typical drunk gamblers doing whatever, so didn’t really bother me. But this last one really has me thinking:

4. There was a guy and women chatting softly a lot too each other between hands. Now they are extremely flippant with checking hole cards, almost lifting the cards fully vertically.  I end up taking her stack in one hand, then then both get up from the table and he pulls out more chips for her and she rebuys and i hear someone joke something like “the wife costing you again”. So they are obviously partners. The problem is, she has her stack on her left and keeps cards on her right. He has his stack on right and keeps cards on his left. So the cards are really close. Now i’m thinking not only were they flashing each other their hands to each other, but made me very eagle eyed to check they were not card swapping. During play both would have both hands over the top of cards and often the back of each other’s hands would be basically touching.

I ended up felting the wife a second time before both left. They were never in any sort of major hand together."

poker,HH from a SnG tonight.,"EDIT: I made a mistake when typing this up last night. The flop was monotone.

Home game that we run every week, usually between 7 and 18 people.

We are down to 3. Hero has \~18bb, villain has us covered with \~42bb.

Villain is somewhat loose but is a reasonably capable player, capable of 4-bet bluffing, betting draws, normal not-noob stuff.

I'll first post my line and then I'll ask some questions.

Hero: Button with JTcc. Opens to 2.5x. SB folds, BB calls.

Flop: JT7ddd. SB leads for \~5bb. Hero calls.

Turn: 2c. SB jams. Hero folds.

QUESTIONS:

\#1. Preflop: Is this a standard open if we expect to scoop the blinds a reasonable amount of time? If villain 3-bets (say to \~9bb), can we fold or do we call with only about a pot sized bet behind?

\#2. Flop: When villain leads into us, how much AdXx do we put in his range, given his somewhat loose image? We discount AJ+, because it's reasonable to expect him to have jammed on us preflop to try and get our (reasonably short) stack in with premium hands. But do we expect him to defend with e.g. A6dd?

\#3. When he leads into us on this flop, if we call we have \~10bb left. Is it better to just shove here? If he calls, the best we're hoping for is e.g. AdJx or AdTx, and we block one JT. We can't reasonably expect him to call with A7, and we're behind 77 and any flush, right? Seems like shoving can't be right.

\#4. When he jams a brick turn, we're basically bluff-catching with 2p here, right? Is this a good bluff catcher or do we just always give this up?

Other general thoughts welcome. Thanks folks."

poker,Live tourney hand thoughts,"From a couple weeks ago, but this hand still on my mind.

Tourney is a live $44 with slow blinds and unlimited rebuys/add ons and several players have dropped significant money at this point (1k+). Tourney is now locked out and approximately 24 players remaining with top 10 in the money. 

Hero was down to 12 BB the hand prior and more than tripled up with a 4 way all in going my way. 

This hand I am UTG with approximately 55-60bb and look down at pocket kings. I open to 2.5bb. Folds to CO who 20x 3bets me. I wasnt paying attention as i was still stacking chips from the previous hand. Several people at the table said ""oh hes all in"". I look up and see his large raise and assume he's all in too. So I say ""I call"" and he immediately flips his cards and I do too.
He has pocket aces vs. my kings. 
At this point the dealer says ""hold on. He has chips yet."" The raiser had been hiding chips with his hands and is not all in. They count out mine vs. his and i have a little left after calling his ""raise"". He has probably 15 bb left and i have about 3bb after the ""raise call"". The dealer has us both cover our cards back up and puts the flop out. T84 rainbow. I check, he shoves of course and I folded. 

The hand was complicated by the weird not all in issue, but I'm more curious if my fold was correct. I'm essentially pot committed, but is it OK to let it go knowing villians exact hand and the flop only giving ~8.4% to still win the hand? In a cash game I know this would be correct, but in tourney play where you're eliminated, is it better to fold and try and rebuild your stack? Had I won this hand I would have been chip leader by a very large margin."

poker,It wasn’t Greed that got Postle caught,"A common theme for Postle getting caught was if he just had of lost some back to the game sometimes, he could of kept this going forever.

This isn’t possible for a man like Mike 

Mike Postle’s ego and narcissistic personality got him caught. He loved being ‘The Man’ around Stones casino and being known as being an amazing poker player. This became his identity as a person and eventually became more important than money.

What was the first thing he did when all this came out? Went on The Mouths podcast to talk about how amazing of a poker player he is. Rationalizing his plays by saying he does it cause ‘ It makes a great story’.  Perfect example of little man syndrome and will do or say anything to earn the respect of his peers.

After 15 years of grinding and with how he was playing pre July 2018, at 2:01, likely not a very big winner and not much,  if any respect from his peers.

He finally got what he always wanted, to be known as one of the best players amongst his peers and constantly receiving praise in a public outlet.

The money was important no doubt, but that is only part of it. His ego is what has gotten him caught in the end and his new found identity meant just as much if not more than the money.

I hope the lawyers working for the players see this post or are already working on this as I think it establishes another motive we can use. Money is obviously one Motive but I think public praise and respect from his peers is another motive and eventually became more important than the motive of money."

poker,Calculating pot odds ?,"Hello, I have a question about calculating pot odds. 

Let’s say you find yourself heads-up at the river against villain. 

Pot entering the river is $100. Villain leads out for $50, making the pot $150. 

Are the pot odds “Bet to Call” / “Current Pot” — $50/$150 = .33?

Or is it “Bet to Call” / (“Current Pot” + “Bet to Call”) — $50/$200 = .25?

I suspect the .33 is correct. If so, the correct way to interpret this would be that you need to win the hand 33% of the time to be a profitable call, right?"
poker,PLO flop question,"Lately I haven't been playing the best and I am looking for feedback regarding folding to Cbets. 

What is a good fold to cbet %? Fold to turn bet after missed flop?

I try to play a relatively balanced strategy, so my opponent shouldn't feel like my checking range is empty.

But I run into spots with a medium strong hand where my opponent will barrel pot two streets and I am usually folding to the river bet when a bad card comes for my holdings

It makes me think that you could play against me and just pot every street and somewhere along the way I will find a fold.

It might be sample size, but I was looking for some feedback. Unfortunately, I am just at lunch, so i cant post specific hands. I will look to do so in the future.

edit: It's actually $30 Million :
https://www.pocketfives.com/articles/postle-kuraitis-and-stones-subect-of-multimillion-dollar-lawsuit-626929/

In addition to the funds lost by the players to Postle in the game, they are seeking damages of $10,000,000 against Postle and his a yet unnamed ‘confederates’ for fraud based on the allegations of cheating.

The plaintiffs are also seeking damages of $10,000,000 against Stones Gambling Hall as an entity for constructive fraud as “Stones has a legal duty to monitor the Stones Live Poker game for cheating and take reasonable steps and measure to prevent the occurrence of cheating therein.” They claim that Stones did not meet the industry standard for security.

The complaint is seeking another punitive $10,000,000 sum against Stones and Kuraitis on a count of fraud based on Kuraitis’ alleged dismissing of the initial allegations and potential cover-up.


Players that are suing:

plaintiffs are Brill, Kasey Lyn Mills, Marc Goone, Kavroop Shergill, Jason Scott, Azaan Nagra, Eli James, Phuong Phan, Jeffrey Sluzinski, Harlan Karnofski, Nathan Pelkey, Matt Holtzclaw, Jon Turovitz, Robert Young, Blake Alexander Kraft, Jaman Yonn Burton, Michael Rojas, Hawnlay Swen, Thomas Morris III, Paul Lopez, Rolando Cao, Benjamin Jackson, Hung Sam, Corey Caspers, and Adam Duong.

The lawsuit also names John Does 1-10 and Jane Does 1-10 as defendants. This inclusion allows other Stones employees and members of the “Stones Live” production team to be added to the lawsuit at a later date.

""All told, any damages won by the plaintiffs will be distributed on a pro rata basis among the plaintiffs. Each plaintiff would be awarded a share based on the number of minutes he or he spent at the table during the 68 streamed sessions where cheating allegedly occurred. Lead attorney Verstandig himself participated in one of the streamed games but is barred from being one of the plaintiffs under state and federal law. Nonetheless, he brings first-hand knowledge of the streamed games to the proceedings.""

.05/.10 zoom on pokerstars, I'm in the BB (214BB stack) with Ad 8c, folds to the Button (230BB) he raises to 3BB. SB (120BB) and I call.

Flop comes 8s 8d 10c (8BB)

SB checks, so do I, thinking Button will Cbet a lot. Button does indeed bet 4BB, SB folds, I call as a raise will just fold out lower hands and there arent a lot of draws that can beat me on the turn. 

Turn comes 4h (16BB)

I check, although now thinking about it I maybe should consider betting about 60% pot as I might miss out some value from hands like Q10 by checking. He bets 8BB, I call. Again, raising makes no sense as im just going to get called by better hands (maybe an 8 calls me, but Id rather keep the pot small).

River comes 6h (32BB)

Here i decide to lead and try to get value from a weaker 8 which might check back the river as the board is so dry. I decide to go for a larger size, that allows me to fold to a raise. 
So I lead into him for 22BB. Guess what, he raises to a staggering 97BB! In my eyes this is just always a fullhouse. Either 10 10; 8 10 suited or 4 4. Even if he had some kind of draw (J9; 97) he would never bluff here in my opinion. And trips just call this off and also never bluff here.

""*I also believe, though I have not went through it, that if you follow through from that point, that you will see his cheating evolve from having the phone in his lap and arms on the table.........He then goes away from his looking straight down, as he does on July 18th, to later his patent turn my head straight down with my hat forward and don't mind me I'm just checking my hole cards..........""*

I took a break from all of this today, but somehow, I find myself right back in it.

While visiting a non-poker friends house earlier, he brought this topic up and I showed him my time-lapse video of Postle from Jan to July, which is the 2nd video I uploaded. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zYySMEWzE0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zYySMEWzE0).

I responded to a remark he made and I said yeah, I think he starts checking his hole cards differently after that video too, but I have not went through all the footage yet.

My friends said, yeah that makes sense, that's why he moved his chips.

I was like, he did what?

He said, yeah look, in your video he plays with his chips in front of him, and all those videos I saw everywhere else he plays with his chips to the left and checks his cards close to the rail so he can look in his lap.

So I fast forwarded to July 18th and he played over his chips, with them in between his arms and makes his checks in front of his chips.

I come home and start looking through footage from the time lapse, and every session July 18th and before he plays over the top of his chips between his arms, even in the July 18th session where he awkwardly looks down between his legs.

I look at his first session right after July 18th in like August.  And for the first time goes to his checks to the right of his chips stack with the cards completely against the rail.  I look at next session, same, Sept session, same, Nov session he has huge stack and is playing over them but then does his check to the left of the stack still, fast forward to 2019 and he still does his checks against the rail to the right of the stack from his perspective.

After July 18th, Mike Postle changes his checks pattern and moves his chips stack to the left, and looks back 10x more often in the middle of a hand, neither of which he did before the July 18th stream."

poker,A5 suited Advice.,"
I am a recreational player who plays 1/2 and tournaments.  Iv played 223 hours this year and lost $1800 so I am not a winning player but I am not loosing a whole lot.  Half of that 223 hours was tournaments and in total iv bought in for $9350 (still only lost a total of $1800).  So I do not consider myself a fish but I do not consider myself good either.

Now here is where I need some advice because I do not think I played the hand all that badly but a few people at the table gave me hate for it.  I then had to sit next to them talking for the next hour and them making snide remakes about my play style.

I am BB with around $270 in chips.  I sat down with $100 so I am ahead.   (I sit down with $100 and buy more chips if I feel it is needed after I get a feel for the table.  Iv been at the table now for about 2 hours and most of that hovered around $250-350 after a few very good pots in the first 30 minutes).

A5 suited as big blind.  I get 3 limpers before it gets to button who raises it to $12.  I call the $12.  2 limpers also call for a 4 way pot.

Flop comes 234 rainbow.  I hit the straight.

I check because in the few hours iv been here iv seen no flop not get a bet and am confident someone will bet.  Sure enough we get one bet to $10 and button raises it to $30.

At this point there is $79 in the middle.  I know I have the best hand currently as they likely do not have a 56 as it is not in either of their ranges.  

What would you do at this point?

A few things to note:  

The $10 ($180 stack) better tries to buy pots a lot and half the time will fold to a re-raise.  He also has a tendency to over value pairs.

The $30 ($500) better is only one of three raisers at the table.  (rest limp in)  Re-raises often and most of the time has strong hands even if they haven't connected yet."

Button straddle of $10, MP calls the straddle and I look down at AKo in the CO. I raise to $50 hoping to isolate one of the two players, or take this pot down now. BTN calls, and MP folds. BTN is a passive player, having folded to my aggression several times.

poker,cash grinder played pretty much first MTT,"ok so it wasn't my first MTT. i have played about 10 or 15 of them but never really made it to a Final Table. ive made probably 1 before this. so last night i made a weird decision to fire an MTT because i had TM on BOL from grinding cash all the time. it was a 9 max which i completely regret doing. all in all i made the FT and got 4th place. by the time the MTT was over i was so sick of poker and just mentally drained from it that i couldn't even fathom doing my daily cash session or even watch twitch poker which i usually do while grinding cash. the MTT probably lasted about roughly 4 hours or so..

poker,New Theory on HOW Mike Postle cheated (without help),"After watching the video posted today from Matt Berkey on how the graphics software works, it occurred to me a way the Mike Postle could have done this all alone.  We know that Mike has a good relationship with the Stones management.  We know that Mike has some knowledge of how the system works simply based on being there.  It is likely that at some point Mike was in the back production room with some of the Stones people and was able to see what software is being used to make things work.  It would be a simple process for him to go look up that software and get a basic understanding of it.  If you watch Berkey's video its very straight forward.  Given this knowledge and his relationships, he could know that management is watching the stream live.

Now, here is what I suspect happened.  He was just casually in the back room one day armed with enough information to know he just needed to see that IP address and he would be good to go.  He could just simply ask, “So how does all this stuff work.”  Because everyone knows Mike, some production guy just shows Mike the basics all the while Mike knows this information already and during this little demo, the guy clicks on the stream tab and BINGO Mike sees the IP address of the server.  Think about how simple this would be to pull off and no one would ever realize or suspect anything nefarious about it.

All Mike needs to do now is log on the the Stones wifi and it will be the same network as the stream most likely and enter the URL of the server stream in a media player on his phone and now he has full access to the hole cards in real time and no one has a clue.This would also explain how no one from Stones was involved as he could have found someone else to watch the stream live for him and feed him information after the phones were removed from the stream.

Just my thoughts."

poker,How would Mike Postle have played this hand?,"6-handed, home game tournament. 500-1000 blinds. 

Fool raises to 4k from late position after me and two other dumbasses limp in... I have 4h5h so naturally I call because, well, I’m suited. Anyway, flop comes 2h9h3d. Fool goes all in for nearly 50bbs (he’s chipleader). So me, second in chips, calls because, well, I’m suited. He has pocket 2’s. How would Mike Postle have played this differently?"
poker,Would you make this call?,"1/3 home game that plays more like 2/5. 

Had a group of 6 playing. 7th shows up about an hour in. He buys in for $500. Tons of chirping and talking shit right off the bat. 

He starts making very aggressive bets. Gets called a few times. Half the time he has it, other half has something but loses. 

Anyway on this hand I’m dealt A9o on the button. Someone opens for $20. A couple callers including villain. I three bet to $50. Again, a couple of callers including villain. Pot is around $220. 

Flop is A 2 2.  A couple of bets. gets villain and he shoves for a little over $500.  Everyone folds. Action is on me. I cover him. I tank for a minute. And make the call betting he doesn’t have the 2 or have me out-kicked."
poker,Theoretically sustainable winrate at zero rake whale filled home game?,"I'm a winning microstakes and 2/5 player who's now been blessed with a large poker community at my college when consistent daily games filled with the worst players imaginable. I know 7bb/hr is a goal number at raked games but what is possible with no rake? At first glance it might be thought to be just an additional 4-5bb/hr to account for what's taken out of your winnings, but another important factor is that stacks get incredibly deep because no money is taken off the table and these players have no idea at all how to play differently with over 100bb. 

My winrate at these games is stupidly high and I always thought just variance in my favor waiting to be corrected by sample size but after a few hundred hours I'm getting real curious as to what is a realistic winrate.

Has there been any research into the mathematics of what type of win rate is possible under certain conditions?"

I felt I was in the top of my range and made the call to only be shown the goods of villain having aces. If I had AKo I for sure would have found a fold. What should have I done?

poker,Very unusal poker room experience,"Small back story. While I live in Vegas, I travel for work (not poker related). I travel around North America and Europe. I tend to visit poker rooms where I am at. I like new experiences, playing against different types of players, etc. So tonight, I was playing in a small room. In the interest of I do not want to publicly make false accusations, I will keep the location anonymous. I have played in 100s of rooms around the world, but never had an experience like this. 

So, playing 7 handed 1-2 NLH. The game is actually pretty good. A couple of decent players, and a comfortable table.  After about an hour, a few guys come in. The table is only playing 9 handed. 2 of the guys sit down and start playing, but the 3rd guy just kind of hangs around the table. Then I notice, the third guy isn't just staying in one spot. He keeps moving behind players, including me. I get really nervous when people are behind me in general, but this guy was starting to get on my nerves. Then I noticed he was standing behind the person that was in the hand and would be texting. He was obviously texting his buddies that were playing. Now I start really getting the feeling something seems fishy here. After about 10 minutes of this, I finally can't stand it anymore. I get up and talk to the floor manager. I explain this guy is making me nervous and something just feels off about the situation. Then, the floor manager said something that shocked the hell out of me. ""That guy? O he is a regular, he is harmless."" I said, okay then. I went back to my seat, grabbed my chips and left the room. I didn't cash out at the poker room, just to a cashier and left.

Was this an overreaction? I have never actually seen cheating first hand. I have become complacent in the game that people are on the up and up. Should I go to the gaming board for this state? Any suggestions/feedback would be appreciated."

poker,My thoughts from my first 2/5 and how it differs from 1/2.,"Since I've read some a few people here asking what are the biggest changes from 1/2 to 2/5, if like to share my first experience

I was playing at MGM Detroit and doing pretty well in 1/2 and decided to hop into the new 2/5 game that was getting started. A few of the 1/2 players joined as well

Min max for the game was 200-1000 I bought in for $500. Was a full table

Here were some of the unexpected things: (this will not come as a surprise to people who play a lot of 2/5 I feel)

-stack sizes are more varried but not the amount of big blinds  At 1/2 everyone typically as between $100 and $300 (50 and 150 BB). At this game there were people ranging from $300 to $1000 (60-150)

-a bit more difficult to quickly calculate the different stack sizes where due to people having a varried amount of $5, $25, and $100 chips

-opening sizings were more consistent. In 1/2 you would see people open to $10 (5bb) but it seemed like $15-$20 was the general open and didn't really vary too much. This will probably change depending on the table as I have a very small sample size. 

-takes a bit to get comfortable with putting in $50 as a 3bet. In terms of bigblinds it's about the same, but there is that psycological thing about putting in $50 vs $25

-since the table seemed more like regulars that play 2/5, I got a sense that some of them where prodding me a bit to see what I would do (which is kinda like I would do in 1/2  to some extent)


Here were some hands:

-folds to be in the CO. I raise to 15 with ATo. Folds to BB who 3bets to 50. I folded as this was more at the bottom of my range and the villian covered me by $500, and it was one of the first hands at the table. 

Hand2:
-Effective stakcs are $400. I cover Villian  I raise to 35 in straddled lot from CO with AJcs.

The BTN and the SB call. Pot is $100 with rake. 

Jc4hQh

I raise to $65. 

Both call

As

I raise to $100. 

BTN folds and SB calls. Pot is $500

7h 

He shoved for 190  I call. Villian Shows 56hh

In this hand I like my play except on the turn. I made it way too profitable to call. Making the turn bet 1/3rd of pot isn't too bad as we are still going to get value from flushbdraws, an Ace, QJ, and possibly some Kings with a gutter, but either a $150 bet or a pot size bet I think would have been better.

River, I don't think I'm ever going to walk away from this as it was $200 into a pot of $700. I'm pretty much pot committed and I think there's a good chunk of time someone will call with AT, an Ah semibluff, and QJ, as well as some A4 and chopping with AJ. When I calculated it out, it was 69 different combos that I win gainst vs 32 that I loose to. This is assuming what actions where taken. If j think he could have any flush possible, then it becomes a much worse call. 

Random hand:
-not my pot but just a crazy one. 5 all ins preflop- about a $1800 pot.  AK vs JJ vs KK vs [muck]. The guy closing the action folded and after he said he had 55. This gave me a good opportunity to review the math if I was ever in that situation. Turns out if you put the villian on JJ+ AKs, AKo, you just barley loose money in the long term. But I found it interesting that a hand like 76s is a pretty big favorite for that position. 


I ended up shipping my last $70 with pocket 77s after the AJ hand above and somehow Quadrupled up. Ended up working the stack up for a profit of $90. 

What I'm going to take away from this to apply for my 1/2 games:
-get to understand the bottom of your ranges a bit more. I think the ATo is a good example of that. 

-think more in terms of BB

-think about SPR more. How much am I leaving behind for the later streets? Does it make sense to shove now or try and induce a bluff?

poker,"I worked in tech room at Stones in 2017 and early 2018. Here are my, admittedly meager, two cents.","First of all, I have no idea if anyone was helping MP cheat.  Like many others, I was extremely skeptical of the accusations when I first heard about them.  MP was a known winner  and he always seemed like a good guy.  But the evidence is pretty substantial, and even from the little that I have seen, he has to have known the hole cards of his opponents.  Justin also always came off as a great guy, and I hope he is innocent, though his dismissal of Veronica's accusations and excuse (Martingale theory?  Really?) were very disappointing to hear about.

Anyway, I had some thoughts that I wanted to share.  First, the techs in the booth are not IT guys.  We are poker players.  The producers of the show have a lot more IT knowledge, but the techs are there because we can follow the action and understand the game.  And the techs are in constant communication with the dealers (via headsets), so the dealers can tell us bet amounts, and we can tell the dealers when we are not getting a player's cards.  We occasionally had to manually enter a player's cards when the reader just would not pick them up, and the hand went to showdown (which was obviously the only way to know their cards).

The producer guy was almost always watching the stream.  He was fine tuning commentator audio, replying to chat, and doing other stuff that I don't know about.  He was rarely watching hands in progress, instead watching hands that happened 30 minutes ago.  Justin was rarely in the booth once we were recording.

I feel like the 9-8ss hand was suspicious, but I don't necessarily think that it is the smoking gun that everyone else thinks that it is.  During interesting hands in the booth, the techs would be discussing what we thought players were going to do (remember that we are poker players, and this was the fun of the job).  When MP shoved over the river raise for so little more, it seemed impossible to be a bluff.  It seems a lot more possible when you realize that he had been cheating, but at the time I'm guessing they assumed the cards had to be wrong, and he had to have the straight.  The stupid thing they did was change the display without physically seeing the cards, which they should have known that you never do.  And 9s8s is just the quickest and easiest way to enter 9-8 (spades are on top on the display), so the suits are a red herring imo.  I may be completely off base, but this seems to me to be the most likely possibility.

Additionally, the commentators don't see anything happening live (unless you count looking across the room at the table).  They watch the feed from 30 minutes ago, so having a commentator as a conspirator makes zero sense to me.  Every additional person added to a scam is a huge risk to blow the whole thing, not to mention another split of the money.  I think it is extraordinarily likely that MP either acted alone, or had very few conspirators."

poker,NEW BREAKDOWN OF GUMPNSTEIN MIKE POSTLE CHEATING VIDEO + NEW POSTLE RESULTS,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dH5uaaCmvpM


First off - GUMPNSTEIN is a fucking god. Amazing breakdown and video. Thank you so much for making it, it is so perfect. I took a look at GUMPNSTEIN's video and also went over new data compiled on Mike Postle results that show 77/87 winning sessions and up +328,000. 

For those that say there is enough information compiled - I don't believe that is true. I have no idea what that even means. How can you have enough information compiled if the guy and whoever he worked with are still out there. The more information that people see, the more information new people might find or see for themselves. If I didn't make so many LIVESTREAMS - GUMPNSTEIN wouldn't have made this video. GUMP seems me doing HOURS of livestreams each night and decides, fuck this, I'm making my own video. Which leads us to this. Which then this video might lead us to who knows what. This is the most interesting thing I've seen happen in poker in a very long time. I think talking about it for more than a week is perfectly fine. 

ENJOY REDDIT MUCH LOVE"
poker,Just came across what may be the most logical explanation of how Postle is cheating...,"So I just read the manual for PokerGFX, which is the software that is used at Stones as well as LATB and other various poker streams,  and came across this gem about MultiGFX.

&gt;MultiGFX: Run unlimited multiple copies of PokerGFX from a single table, for multiple video streams each with their own individual graphics and stream delay settings...   
&gt;  
&gt;MultiGFX: ForcesPokerGFX to sync to another primary PokerGFX running on a ***different, networked computer***, making it possible to generate multiple live and delayed video streams with different graphics, from the same table. ***This is achieved by running multiple copies of PokerGFX on separate computers which are networked together.***   
&gt;  
&gt;Enabling the ‘MultiGFX’ option *forces* PokerGFX to use another running copy of PokerGFX as a data source instead of a physical RFID table.

Basically what this means is that ANYONE with a laptop and wifi password is able to run their own copy of PokerGFX, click MultiGFX option which then uses all the data from the other running copy of the software in the back as the data source. It basically duplicates the entire system onto a different computer... This means anyone in wifi range could access the cards in real-time and message Mike on WhatsApp or the messaging app of their choosing. 

The pages of the manual relevant to this are in PDF here [https://www.docdroid.net/VLB2oft/multigfxinfo.pdf](https://www.docdroid.net/VLB2oft/multigfxinfo.pdf)

I am convinced now that this is the method of attack. It only requires a separate copy of the software on a laptop that is connected to the same network. 

I asked /u/PokerJunkieKK about the casino wifi that the software could possibly have been operating on. His/Her reply was: 

&gt; It was password protected, though not too difficult to guess. And it didn't change the whole time I was there. 

[https://np.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/dep808/i\_worked\_in\_tech\_room\_at\_stones\_in\_2017\_and\_early/f2ysjlu?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://np.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/dep808/i_worked_in_tech_room_at_stones_in_2017_and_early/f2ysjlu?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

&amp;#x200B;

Once the PW is cracked/guessed, anyone within wifi range could connect to the main copy of the software running and get all the same information in real-time.

I am not a tech-guru or anything. I don't have a copy of PokerGFX to test if this is actually that easy. I am merely pointing out what I have found which gave me kind ofan ""aha"" moment. This makes perfect sense and by the manual, it seems incredibly easy once you guess the password(s). 

I want this information to reach the powers that be in this case and hopefully all the way to the people assigned to the investigation. Hopefully they are looking at every single angle but this theory seems to be one of the more easier ones, and does not involve any help from the inside."
poker,Run good vs. natural variance,"One of the first clues we had that Mike P was cheating was his winning streak on the stream. It made me check my history and I seem to only reach stretches of 8-10 wins.

poker,Just a question about free rebuy tournaments,"Hey guys, I’ve started playing in a pub league and the way it works is you pay your entry and get 3500 in chips with blinds starting at 25/50 but increasing every 10-15 minutes or so. When you first bust out you get a free reentry of 5000 more chips or if you are still in at half time (blinds are 200/400 by that point) you get the 5000 chips as an add on.

My question is whether it’s a better strategy to take more risks early where if you do bust out your rebuy is still a fairly large stack in comparison to the blinds or try and play safe poker and hope to add the chips to your stack at half time?

Cheers in advance and good luck out there"

poker,(1/2 Live) HELP! AITA for calling several shoves with 65s?,"Before you criticize me, people were frequently shoving 33, A4o, KJs at that table. It was that kind of table.

Also want to say that I got AA on my very second hand at that table, lost my stack and rebought, then proceeded to get NOTHING. This 65s was the first ""playable"" hand I got in three hours.

$200 stack, UTG has $175, other people have close to $200.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

MP raises to $8, one call, and CO 4bets to 22. Now normally I think I could easily fold this hand (65s) but I read a TON about poker and I remembered the following things:

1) You should mix your 4bet strategy here and there. Don't just 4bet there with AA 

2) I haven't played a hand in ages, so I have a tight image at that image.

3) Suited connectors actually have a lot of equity; they fare the best against AA!

4) CO 3-betting range vs MP is actually fairly large, with a lot of hands I can make fold.

With that in mind, I 4bet to 80, simply announcing ""eighty."" MP goes into tank, then announces he is all-in. Of course I feel super depressed at this point, I have to fold, and I kiss my $80 goodbye. 

The other guy thinks for a while, doesn't seem to like the situation too much, but eventually calls. CO pushes his chips in silently and I am about to fold when I start to think to myself: ""Hold on a minute. There's a sh!tton of money in that pot."" I count it and it's very close to $800. I have to call $120 to win a $800. Something something 15% equity, but do I have it?

I tank forever, trying to remember formulas, wondering how 65s fares against AA, KK and let's say TT. I get  to a figure of 12% which I have no idea whether it is accurate or not (it's not, it's 19.86%, so a snap call). I then put the first guy on top 5%, second on top 8% and third on top 15%, and I calculate my equity to be 14% (it's not, it's 22%). I don't have the equity. Then I realize these guys shove anything and call anything, so I call anyway.

Board runs 89226 rainbow

So I make a pair but obviously it's not enough.

Well...

Guy #1 shows AK, guy #2 AK as well, guy #3 shows 33 and I win the MASSIVE pot with my f\*cking pair of 6s lololol

Immediately, first guy who shoved gets mad, his face gets all red and puffy, he starts bitching about that f\*cking """"""""""""cooler"""""""""".

To make it worse, I """"""""""only"""""""" tip the dealer $2 and he starts berating me about tipping too little, saying ""I could tip more with the massive luck I've just gotten"" or some BS like that. I ignore him and he gets more mad. He then says that he has money, makes a good living, has a good salary, blah blah blah. I'm not even sure why he started saying that but w/e. I did notice he had a nice watch, also he was wearing a suit.

I ignore it mostly but it keeps going, hand after hand. I would expect him to cool down, but in fact, as hands pass, he gets more and more pissed. Then finally he says:

""That's the problem with AK,"" one guy says. ""A fucking donk calls you out of nowhere with a bullshit hand and hits a miracle pair out of nowhere.""

""Hey chill out,"" I say.

""Chill out? You made a terrible call and you sucked out. Again."" H

e keeps going, until I evenutally say:

""Excuse me, you said you earned a lot of money, right?""

""Right?""

""So you can afford a psy (psychologist, which act as therapists here) then. And you can pay him to hear your bitching all you want.""

He raises a hand and I 3bet him with TT in poz. At this point he was raising every hand to try and get back at me I guess. He folds his hand, fuming, and I say:

""That's $20 (his raise). A psy charges $300 per hour, or $5 a minute. For $20 I'll listen to your bitching for four minutes. Tell me about your wife that hates you and your son that hasn't talked to you in a decade. ""

At this point, people at the table started calling me an asshole, telling me to ""drop it."" Keep in mind he had been berating me for close to ten minutes. I think I was in my right to do what I did, but I don't know.

Am I the asshole here?"

poker,PLO: Nut straight plus two pair facing a flop raise on a two flush board from a competent reg,"I get into this situation sometimes in PLO and want to know if my thinking is correct or not. 

$0.50/1 online, 6 handed, $140 deep

LAG in CO opens 3.5x, V (tight winning reg) calls OTB, Hero (tight winning image) calls SB with QhJsTh9d, BB calls.

Flop ($14): JsTd8d

H leads $14, fold, fold, V raises to $56



Does a competent winning player ever do this without the nuts plus a flush redraw? I would say very unlikely he does this with the naked nuts or even KQ9x.

If he does indeed have the nuts+a flush redraw, he has 8 outs vs just 4 of mine. 

1) What is the correct play here? Is folding ever an option if we put the opponent on exactly that? 

2) If we do just call, do we lead shove or check/call safe turns? 

3) If the turn is a J or T, the guy may probably not put a dime more in the pot. Is there any way we can extract more value out of him?"

poker,"Not trying to jump on the Mike Postle bandwagon, but I have an idea how his cheat worked.","I implemented an RFID inventory system for a manufacturing company I used to work for. Poker cards use standard 13.56 mhz RFID chips. With standard antennas the 13.56 chips can only be read a few feet away, the tables are probably designed to only read them inches away, but with a proper antenna, such as one that can be concealed in a phone case, and a bit of programming knowledge one could conceivably write a program to interpret the data and hide an RFID antenna in a phone case and read every card at the table. 

Since the RFID chips are only read when interference occurs, you could simply filter multiple reads at once (which would eliminate reading the deck as it is moved) and your software could eliminate cards as they are moved for a second time (when hands are mucked). This would give you a pretty good idea, and with practice almost certainty, of what cards were out on the table. The software could even report the signal strength and you could infer who has which cards. 

It would take a bit of trial and error to build a database and identify the code the cards were sending out, but I understand he went for six sessions before he started winning. He may have been perfecting his system and then, during the poker hand that will live in infamy, checked his crotch and the rest is history. 

If this is the case, the manufactures need to develop some form of encryption that can prevent data from being read, though I don't know how that would be possible, even if you are only sending encrypted data it would be different for every card and could be easily inferred. Everyone is talking about accomplices but he didn't need any."

poker,I just invented a new poker term: counter-counterfeited. How do I popularize it?,"Obviously we know what counterfeit is, but last night, I had a hand and invented a new poker term which I'd like people to know/use, much like we use ""OMC"" or ""OTB"" today. or counterfeited if you must.

My term is counter-counterfeited, countercounterfeited, or CCF. Here's an example of a CCF that happened last night and helps illustrate what it is:

$1/$2 live effective stack 275 (omc covers me by $50)

OMC on the SB limps. Several more limpers and I wake up on the BTN to see 99. I raise to $14 and OMC of course 3bets to $45. One caller and I decide to call as well.

I want to say, this OMC is the most typical OMC of all OMCs in the world, down to the coffee. He ONLY 3bets with AA and KK, ever.

Anyway, flop comes T J J. OMC bets $50 in a $135 pot (!?!%!), guy #2 fold, and I decide to call for some reason. Think it's a bit early to fold 99 for this price, but probably not. I think that maybe I can steal on later street; also,  I start to think about how OMC could have AK, which of course he doesn't, so this is a dangerous line of thinking, as he always has AA or KK here.

Turn comes T J J T, so my pair of nines is counterfeited. I even lose to the unlikely AK scenario I was thinking of. Thankfully, he checks for some reason, perhaps afraid I have  T or J. I decide to try to steal the pot and bet $75 in a $235 pot, because why not. He doesn't seem to like it much, but eventually makes the (correct) call.

Then river comes T J J T 9 so my pair of 9s is no longer ""two pairs with 9 high) but a beautiful boat. **In other words, my mid pocket is no longer counterfeited: it got counter-counterfeited.**

He checks, and I bet my remaining chips (like $100). He sighs, goes well into timebank, and eventually decides on a call, saying ""I know you have a T or a J."" Sure enough, he has AA and I win the hand. He's pissed, but doesn't say a word.

So this is what a CCF is. How do I get people to adopt this slang?

Thx."

For the next, not an exaggeration - 15 minutes everyone at the table was talking about the hand and this lady’s like “how could he call with k/8 on flop yada yada” another guys like “not only that HE RAISED PREFLOP”, etc etc.  (I stayed silent and stared felt entire time after tabling hand)

Pick up another hand UTG, 6/7 ss, open to $7, all 9 other people at table call, i joke “ah wow yeah nobody will believe me anymore” and only Yung Asian LAG thought it was funny everyone else stone faced me - after the hand was over, even though I didn’t make that much money with the k/8 hand, i had sat down about 20 min earlier and had already doubled up my 200 buy in thru squeezes, etc and them never seeing my hand as never got to showdown, so I figured my table image at this point was just straight shot after the K/8- i just started racking up and dude next to me slams the rails with his hands and is like “ahhh the ole hit n run huh?” I just shrugged and said “yeah feels a little dirty but I gotta go”

Could just feel the tables eyes on me as I walked away. In for 200, out for 499"

I semi-tank and fold with three left to act if I went all in.

Was this fold too tight, or do you do the same with several left to act and no reads on anyone but the LAG villain who almost never bluffs with this big of a preflop reraise?

poker,Locking the pot,"What is your opinion on locked pots? 

The casino I play at has a rule that if preflop there was no raise before the BB, than he has three options: check, raise or *lock*. 

If the BB says lock, the cards are mucked by everyone, limped bets are put in the middle as dead money for the next round, the button moves and the players who folded have the option to put in a BB if they want to play the next hand. This is basically to avoid wasting time on a limped pot. 

Same applies if there is a straddle. Except the straddle player has the lock option if no one raises before him. 

The high rollers at the casino sometimes abuse this rule when they play on low limit tables, while they wait for a big table to open, since they would post a maximum straddle of 5BB and then would lock the pot, so the next hand has like 30 to 40BB of dead money before the flop. 

Anyway, do you know this rule? Do you think it is a good one?"

poker,Mike Postle and the Stones casino should be investigated,"First of all, let me stress, that im not from the US and have little knowledge of the laws in the country/state.

But reading and watching the videos on this theme for the last few days I have 1 question: Why isn't the Stones casino being investigated about this? I can see everybody being pretty sure, that Mike Postle is the cheater (phone, RDIF, etc..). But I haven't seen much thought being put into the casino itself, or at least a part of the staff.

How is he able to still be on his phone, while the phone ban was set up? If ""all"" of the community is acusing him of cheating, how does the casino allow for it to continue? I'm merely speaking for myself, but as a potential owner of the casino, this controversy is making me look extremely bad and I would want it to stop... 

Is there no way to check what he is doing on his phone in the middle of the hand? Is this even allowed in the states?

I am confused about how the casino itself is allowing this to go on if the whole poker world ""knows"" something is not right here..."

poker,Matusow doesn't believe Postle,"I listened to Matusow's interview with postle and the follow up with Ingram and heard a few things that make me think Matusow doesn't buy what Postle is trying to sell. Heres a few reasons I think this:

Matusow said to Ingram that if he was just accusing postle he wouldn't have gotten the interview.

Matusow's wife told Ingram that he was ""falling for it"" after Matusow was talking about how he was getting Postle to relax and talk. Matusow got mad at her for saying this.

Matusow said he has a strong opinion and if you listen closely to the first interview you might catch on, and that it will become clear in the second interview.

Postle was clearly lying a lot in the interview with Matusow and there's no way he fooled Matusow. Even if you don't like Matusow (I can't say I'm a fan), he's got the stats to show he's good and there's no doubt he has some at least some basic ability to detect deception, which is all you need to see Postle's lies.

poker,Thoughts on the Mike Postle Eventual Outcome (not a meme),"I know this discussion is beat past death already but I've finally caught up on the latest interviews and have a couple thoughts to add to it. This is all just opinion based on my own observations.

Mike Postle's interviews with Mike Matusow illustrate his perspective more than vindicate or convict him. He doesn't want be remembered as a cheater who cheated for money alone, whether innocent or guilty. He wants to be very clear on why he did these things and what his life has been like, in my opinion.

I think Matusow did a fantastic job giving Postle a platform. Matusow may have been a bit high, so what, Postle was able to state his piece and provide his own defense to the hundreds if not thousands of posts across all social media platforms over the past couple weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I think there's a very good chance he has been cheating. If you don't agree with me and think he's innocent, that's fine, but look at this video after watching at least a couple hour of his other play ([https://twitter.com/Joeingram1/status/1180651345923018752](https://twitter.com/Joeingram1/status/1180651345923018752)). He acts like a completely different player, in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

I really hope we get some final evidence, I'd like a full investigation and I'd like to know the outcome no matter what. At this point, we need evidence otherwise the poker community *is* going to have issues moving forward. We need to handle this and give satisfaction to all the people who have devoted so much time to this. We also owe due process to the man who is accused, remember that too.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: One more thought for which I have no evidence but could be an interesting turn of events is that Postle could have been put up to this whole scheme by someone else or felt that he had to do it to make money for an unknown reason."

Long story short, I 3bet 99 from the SB and got 2 callers (someone who limped from EP, and a guy in the HJ).

Flop: 9.A,Q rainbow.

I shove all in.

EP folds, HJ goes into the tank.

Note - in a cash game, I don't care how long someone tanks. You can sit there for an hour for all I care. However, in a tournament the clock is always ticking.

It wouldn't have been so bad if he would have been calculating odds or something, but all he was doing was starring me down like some kind of sexual predator. 

He stares at me, I stare back and giggle a little. I turn my head away and take a drink of my soda. I look back over, he's still starring me down. I look down at the cards for a while, look back at him - he's still starring me down. It felt like forever, but it was probably a good solid 3 minutes.

So, I look at the dealer and softly say ""clock"". I think it agitated him a little, but he finally made the call.

I show him my 99s and he slams his fist on the table as he turns over AK.

Board runs out and he doesn't improve and is out.

After he walks off I say:

I ran 3 monte carlo simulations ([in python, sick pun](https://github.com/crinklaw/monte-python/blob/master/4-players-flop-flush.py)), with 100 million simulations per, giving:

**68 per 100 million**

**72 per 100 million**

Which means /u/dhelfr is likely correct.

So, [/u/collypop82](https://www.reddit.com/user/collypop82/), your crazy hand has a both experimental and theoretical likelihood of about **7 in ten million**. This is assuming all 4 suited hands continue to the flop, which easily makes it about **1 in ten million** in practice. Pretty cool, man."

poker,Implications of Postle's conviction on poker's future,"Lately on Joe's chat with Mike Matesow, they mentioned that we should be trying to find evidence that exonerates Postle, on the grounds that if Postle was convicted, poker is going to sink further. Live streams might be banned, WSOP's might not be streamed for security concerns, everything's going to change.

Do you think this is true?

Even if it is, I think if Postle's conviction (if it happens) changes anything, then those changes should rightfully happen. Who would want to play games that have any chance of being cheated in the first place? If live streams can be cheated then the streams need to be made more secure or, frankly, rightfully be taken off, even if it's ""bad for poker"". Is the risk of cheaters worth putting on an insecure live stream? Absolutely not. It's unfortunate, but it's also the reality we have to deal with now.

I don't think the effect on poker should be considered when dealing with Postle. We can't just deny the actual people he allegedly scammed. We can't just let the actual blatant criminal activity get away on camera.

If we work hard on defending Postle and he gets away with it while actually being a cheater, then the outcome for poker will also be bad. Because now even if the game looks better to the public, we've flipped the turn card and found that there's more cheaters in the game than we thought, no matter how good poker in general looks. But now we don't have the community awareness to counter that. We also don't want poker to become a community that fosters and tolerates crime in the name of money and reputation, that feels very disgusting to me.

After watching Joe's streams and how often he calls Postle a god, I thought he was just being satirical, but now I think he's actually trying to defend him unironically in a kind of effort to best the interests of poker. But I think Postle's actions have ruined poker already somewhat whether he is convicted or not, and all options (defend or accuse him) are not ideal. It is too late. If he is guilty, we should be finding evidence against him. If it turns out he is not, well, ugh, I admit that will be the better truth no matter how unlikely, but we'll re-evaluate if that happens. But there is only one truth and we don't get to decide that."

poker,What works in Theory versus what works in practice,"Let's say you are designing some strategies using PIO or something else. And you implement these strategies in your game.

If you are reviewing your results, and you see that different strategies (low frequency plays, or plays that were non-GTO when you review) are performing better than the recommended plays. Or you can see clear adjustments that will improve your results, would you stick to what's strong/correct in theory, or start using the ''weaker'' strategies with the better results based on real hands played? Why do you choose what you choose?

I think leaning towards using the strategies that actually work in real hands is better than designing theoretically correct plays.

This is probably just a rephrasing of the age old adage, GTO vs exploit, but yeah. What would you do?"
poker,Could Someone Explain Reasoning Why You Don't Bet OOP With This Hand,"I'm trying to understand the reasoning in a situation like this and I'm not certain.  

You are in a cash game with effective 100bb stacks.  You are in the CO and it folds to you.  You decide to open a standard 3x and you get raised 2x your raise.  You call because you have JdTd and it plays well postflop and the button is a really loose player.  

The flop comes Qdjc5h and you check and opponent checks.  Now here is where I'm having problems with my reasoning.  The turn comes the 3d and you now have a pair + flush draw.  I always bet this spot but it puts me in a lot of bad situations.  Can you explain the reasoning why check calling this spot is the best play?"

Most of the people I know who play online poker told me they use poker trackers but they wouldn't tell me much more :( All they told me was ""It's much easier to see where your opponent makes most of his mistakes and those exploit them"". The following QNs come up to my mind imidiatly:
1. Are poker trackers legal? (I guess not)
2. What % of the online players use poker trackers? (I guess a lot)
3. How much legitimate poker trackers cost? (I guess less then 200$)
4. What information they usually provide about your opponent? (Please go through this deeply. Do they just relay on the hands you played against that guy or on entire let's say year of hand history that the poker tracker somehow recorded?)
5. How much do you take into account the poker tracker information when you are making a big decision? For example on the river you hold a bluff catcher would you trust a poker tracker (that your opponent is bluffing too much) and call down a huge fishy bet?
6. How poker trackers manage to record all the data they have?
7. Sites where less people use poker trackers you would recommend?
8. Sites to dodge? where vast majority of people use poker trackers due no regulations?
9. Anything else you would like to add."

poker,How to play against amateur players?,"So I‘ve been reading and watching alot of stuff about poker strategy lately and try my best to apply this to my game. Problem ist most of the times I play against frienda that are not that into poker and don‘t read up on poker education, etc..

So they never raise pre flop, ALWAYS call pre flop raises, make weird bet sizes like 4000 on the flop and 500 on the turn and this leads to barely being able to bluff them even if they have like pair of deuces or not being able to define their range so they bet like 200 into a 6000 pot and have a damn full house.

poker,Dnegs chimes in with his analysis of Postle situation,
poker,Was my bluff in this spot correct?,"Partypoker $5.00 No Limit Hold'em - 6 players

LJ: $5.07

HJ: $5.95

CO: $6.93

**Villain (BTN): $5.80**

SB: $4.94

**Hero (BB): $5.41**

&amp;#x200B;

**Preflop** ($0.07) Hero is BB with Ah Qd

3 Fold, Villain raises to $0.12, SB calls, Hero 3-bets to 0.65, Villain calls, SB folds

**Flop** ($0.1.42) Tc Jd 5h (2 players)

Hero bets $0.45, Villain calls

**Turn** ($2.32) 2c

Hero goes all-in for $4.31, Villain calls

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!River ($10.94) Ad!&lt;

&gt;!Villain had Qc Qs so I got saved by an Ace on the river!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to ask what do you think of my line here.

Preflop, range of the BTN is obviously very wide, while a call from SB means SB's range is capped. So with AQo I'm most likely ahead of both players' ranges. So I 3-bet to try to take down the pot pre or isolate the BTN. I believe this play is pretty standard.

I flop a gutshot and have two overcards. I'm thinking this is a great place for a continuation bet bluff. I block hands like AA, AK, QQ which have me beat (although especially AA and also QQ should most likely 4-bet pre), if Villain has nothing he probably folds and if he has Tx or Jx type of hand I still have a lot of equity against those holdings (10 outs). Note that I block AT, JA, QTs and QJs which could all be holdings of Villain. I is also not very likely that Villain has a set at this point since he probably check-raises with a set. So, if Villain has a hand like like J9s, or something like that, I will put him in a tough spot with a double barrel on the turn since he has to float wide on the river.

So the turn comes a very safe 2c. I am thinking I should continue with my bluff for the reasons just described and so I shove. I am thinking, it makes no sense to make a 2/3 pot to pot-sized bet since I'll have basically no fold equity on the river if Villain calls on the turn and I jam $2 into $6 pot on the river.

What do you think of my play? Was this bluff correct or too aggressive? I would appreciate any insights.

Also, I am curious what do you guys think about Villain's plays in this hand. He should probably 4-bet pre. Also, he blocks my potential straight draws type hands and my potentian flush draw hand so maybe he should fold this specific hand on the turn and call with a hand without a club in it?"

I have a few questions about this.

First what gave the announcers any indication that the hole cards being displayed were incorrect?

Second how would they have then figured out what his real hole cards were? If the RFID tags on the cards were wrong they would have no other point of reference.

Hero is dealt AcKd in the BB and shoves for $300

Thoughts?

I considered raising to $120-150 but figured I’m better off maximizing fold equity and avoiding playing a huge pot out of position multi-way. However if it goes heads up I would get it all in regardless of flop at that point due to SPR &lt; 1. I usually play rather deep so I’m not sure what to do with a stack at around 60BBs. I’d say 75%+ of the time though that shove gets 3 folds which makes it seem like a profitable move. The other 25% usually up against TT, JJ, QQ, AK, AQ maybe UTG+1 can have KK or AA once in a blue moon."
poker,Limp/call and limp/reraise.,"In UTG and UTG+1,, I've taken to limp/calling strong hands that you aren't neccesarily supposed to play in those positions( KQo or 22, for example) and limp reraising hands like AA, KK, QQ and even AKo. This with added bluffs to murky the waters.

I was sick of everyone folding when I opened with KK UTG and this seems to be working for me in cash games.

poker,Roast my Line [1/3],"Think I played this hand well, want to see what you all thought of it.

Preflop: Villian (UTG+1) effective stack 300, Hero in the BB has 500. V2 (MP) and V3 (CO) are around 300 as well. First hand at the table for V

V opens to 12. 2 callers. V2 and V3 call. Hero looks at 5c6c in the BB and defends.

Flop ($45): Jc 2d 3s

Hero checks, Villian c-bets to 40. Hero puts Villian on AJ here, sometimes QQ/KK/AA but he seems happy with the dry ass flop. V2 and V3 fold, action on me.

I think about my range. I don't love calling KJ/QJ here with my read as I'm so often beat by overpairs or outkicked and will lose a lot with those hands. I could have A5/A4 here and float, but a lot of my A4/A5 suited hands are in my 3B bluff range facing two limpers preflop so I decide that I should put a hand like 56 with backdoor clubs in every once and a while to make sure I have enough hands to call that can improve on more turns. I decide to call.

Turn ($95): Jc 2d 3s (2c)

Literally if you asked me for a better bluff card I couldn't think of one. I have all the 2x here and turned equity to go with my gutter. V bets $48, I raise to $148 (CO spread max). V calls, $100 back.

River ($394): Jc 2d 3s 2c (4d)

Hit the perfect out, clubs missed though I would have taken a club obviously since AJ can't have clubs here and overpairs can't either. He checks, I bet 100, he calls.

He shows AJ, I show the gutter on the river, people are surprised. They thought I had trips/boat, and the dude tilts off. I tip the dealer $10, he says I should tip the whole pot, and immediately stands up and rebuys. When the player between us leaves, he seat changes to my immediate left and I play tight as balls for a while as I know what's up, eventually rack up and leave."

poker,feelings of being stuck,"hey. im posting this here because idk what else to do, and thought that someone out there could possibly help, or that my story could help someone avoid mistakes i've made

i started playing poker professionally in mid 2017, and for a while it was pretty great. i started out grinding live 1-2 at a local casino while living at home, quickly spun up a roll, and eventually moved to one of the bigger 2-5 NL hubs in the u.s.

my first month there was arguably the worst month of my life. my girlfriend of 4 years had just broken up with me, and that coincided with my biggest career downswing (almost 10k, probably had 55k at start of downswing). dealing with all of these external stressors was not easy for me. I have a history of depression, and all of these things lining up together threw me into one of the deepest holes i've been. there were days (prob less than 5) i spent 20+ hours in bed; only getting up to smoke some weed or find some shit food to eat.

i took some steps to pull myself out of this zone. hired a therapist, regular exercise, attempting to eat healthier, self-help books, etc. all of this, and some run-good on the poker tables, had me back to a fully-functional (and arguably stronger) 2-5 grinder.

i basically god-moded for the next 6 months or so. I prob made 45k with one or two 5-8k downswings thrown in along the way. I'd begun playing 1-2 on ignition (initially for practice/ studying, but then continued bc games were good my hourly there was comparable to my hourly grinding live 2-5) and consequently got my hands on some bitcoin. i was already somewhat familiar with what it was and was generally bullish (still am) so figured i'd hold on to a couple of the fuckers since the roll was so healthy and it seemed like a decent mid-long term investment. well, what fucking timing this turned out to be, as price soared from 4k to rougly 8k by end of may. it was around this time that i think my success began to go to my head a bit. i mean, not that i had done anything particularly grand, but i def had a somewhat constant euphoric buzz going on basically around the clock. I was 25, had over 100k nw, had investments that seemingly were going to be worth millions in the not-so distant future (/s), and worked my dream job in which i was able to get away with whatever the fuck i wanted. ""Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta,"" was like my life theme song, playing wherever i went. is this kind of phenomenon experienced by other pros when upswinging?

it's summer now, and the dreams of shipping a tournament are abundant. i create a \~15k package, and sell about a 1/3 of myself to maintain sanity in case things go poorly (net worth  &gt;100k at this point, abi mtt is probably 1100). my lease expires at my current spot, so i'm off to vegas to bluff johnny chan or something.

...or something indeed! i cashed just 1 out of probably 12 tournaments and broke even in cash. it felt not good, but I think i had/have a better understanding as to how big variance is (especially in mtts) relative to most, so I was pretty ok with this. not to mention, btc had topped at 14k, which def made dealing with the negative mtt variance a bit easier.

the highlight of my wsop was day 1 of the main event (didnt initially plan on playing, but I was able to sell 75% and it'd been a dream of mine to play since i was a kid, so fuck it, ill take a shot). my table is a joke. it is unfathomable to me that these types of players both exist AND somehow have $10k to light on fire in a poker tournament. one of my table mates felt the need to heavily exemplify the lack of fucks he gave about this $10k. the dude showed up for the tournament pretty drunk (started at 10am, LOL). first, he has this weird interaction with the dealer where he sits down in seat 5 and dealer tells him he's in the wrong seat, and to move to 6. it takes the guy an abnormal amount of time to understand, but eventually he figures it out and moves over. ok, let's run it. few hands go by and the drunk guy scoops a small pot (probably less than 1k chips and we started with 50k). the seat next to him is unoccupied but there is a stack in front of the seat that is blinding out. as drunk guy scoops his pot, he ""accidentally"" scoops the chips next to him, in what appeared to either be an extremely slick (/s) attempt to find an early double, or an attempt at a bad joke. imo, it was most likely either a poorly timed joke or the dude was just so fucked up that he just didn't realize what he was doing, but we will never know for sure. either way, jack effel promptly dq'd the guy, which i think was absolutely too harsh. i still regret not jumping to this guy's defense, as i really doubt there were any truly ill intentions behind his actions.

one more quick highlight from my day 1 : i mentioned my table being a dream, and it was, with the exception of one player. a former main event champ, joe mckeehen. i didn't know much about him prior to this except that he was a part of chance's Chip Leader Coaching team, which made me think he was prob a beast. and i was right... the guy undoubtedly had an edge on me (and ofc rest of table) and both played and carried himself extremely well. i played one hand vs him that was noteworthy, particularly because of what he said to me afterwords.

cant remember exact sizing's so bear with me: joe opens hj 2.2x, button call, i call bb with td8h. flop: q67r. i check, joe cbet 1/3 pot, button fold, i call. turn: 4x (i think i could do some leading on this card since i improve to straights and 2p at higher frequency than joe, but who tf am i to just lead into the former champ??) i check, joe bets 2/3. i think x/c and x/r are both fine, but decide on x/r this time. sizing was something where i'd set myself up for 80-90% jam on the river if he called. joe takes a few seconds, and as he's picking up his cards to throw them into the muck, says something like, ""i really don't believe you, but i'm not going to call you down. don't do that again, kid."" what a thing to fkn say man, absolutely legendary. he folds. i think to myself, ""i've bluffed the champ! call me mike mcd mother fkers.""

in all seriousness though, he obv did pick up on some sort of live read, but even with whatever that was, i think over-folding a high-variance, bluff-catching spot vs the only other competent player at the table makes a lot of sense given this is day 1 of the main event and our table is a complete and total joke. wp joe, and thank you for the story. a true legened, imo.

anyway.. fast forward to day 3 of the main and i'm out a few hours before making the money. talk about maximum pain, man. i felt i'd basically avoided any real feelings of tilt/ disappointment prior to this despite a pretty brutal summer, but busting the main was a scratch on the surface of the negative emotions/ tilt i'd buried during the bad downswing i had after my initial move away from home.

the roll is still healthy. the price of btc is falling, but my nw is still around 95k. even though i still have plenty of money and am well-rolled for the main game i want to play (1500 cap 5/t), i have this weird psychological block where it feels like i dont have enough. i think i began to feel this more so when i dipped below 100k. it's like my brain has this weird obsession or belief that i need to be over 100 to be complete (i know, sounds insane, but again, im curious if others experience this kinda thing?) somewhat dejected, i head back home to spend a few weeks with the family before i head out to boston to set up a new home-base.

fast forward to now: i've been renting a room at an air bnb for a little over a month. i'm breakeven over my last 700 hours of live poker (about 175 of those are me losing \~15k at mtt's). i've played about 135 hours of 5-t since moving to boston and an stuck about 6k. pretty normal i think. btc price back down to 8k though, so that + life expenses has brought the networth down to about 85k (70k liquid). i know, i know... plenty of money, even for playing 5-t. but holy fuck man, it does not feel that way. i feel like i did a year and a half ago when i first moved to the 2-5 hub and was dealing with downswing + major breakup. it's quite difficult to even get out of bed and take a shower. forget getting my ass down to the casino and actually putting in some volume in the volatility-chamber. it simply doesnt feel possible. it feels especially risky. like i want to avoid even giving myself the chance to book another losing session because i know how much it'd hurt. do other pros deal with shit like this? if so, what kinds of techniques do you use to combat these feelings? is there a way i can trick my brain into thinking more rationally?

idk how i feel about actually posting this shit. i'm pretty self-concision in general. i will say that writing this out has been therapeutic in some way, and i do feel a bit better. maybe tomorrow will try and do a low-volatility online session. going to try to get outside and get some sun while i still can today. enjoy the spew/ wsop main event weirdness"

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

so i think my mistakes are starting preflop, where i must 4bet my AK when 2 players are still behind, maybe its ok faltting when you are heads up closing the action, ive noticed in those stake people only getting it in preflop with AA KK QQ and maybe AK so i got used to flatting, which is fine i think, but not in this situation.

Next mistake is on the flop when to preflop 3bettor checks its just obvious QQ or JJ, so i just should start betting.

On the turn i finally bet 0.72 into 1.20 and i think it might be a little too small, but maybe its fine.

On the river im really not sure whats the right play here after i screwed myself throughout the entire hand, so i go for x\\c and he shows 28s. well he did made a questionable call preflop but thats not the point, i could've dont a lot things more correctly, and ill be happy to hear your guys opinion about what i shouldve done in this hand that i didnt already figured.

\--------------

So ill try to redeem myself with one that i think i did played good:

&amp;#x200B;

Player2 ( $1.77 USD ) - VPIP: 29, PFR: 19, 3B: 5, AF: 2.3, Hands: 1801

me and villian recent dynamic: had a lot of pots together that i won most of them, or kept making him fold.

&amp;#x200B;

i have 3.03$

Dealt to Hero \[  2s As \]

Player5 folds

Player6 folds

Player1 calls \[$0.02 USD\]

Player2 calls \[$0.02 USD\]

Hero raises \[$0.11 USD\]

Player4 folds

Hero checks

Player2 bets \[$1.11 USD\]

Hero calls \[$1.11 USD\]

**Player2 shows \[results at the buttom\]**

&amp;#x200B;

so in this hand i like my iso raise pre flop, on the flop its a standard Cbet i think and the reason i barrel the turn is that he just kept floating me on the flop for the whole session and then folding the turn, so i kept double barreling him always. when he calls me twice i think he might have a hand like K9 QT or a draw like JT 9T J9 or even 78dd 89dd (thats less likely but he floats the flop a lot so i think its still in his range and got the backdoor diamonds).when he jams the river it doesnt make sense to me that he have a value hand like AK KQ because he does not limp those, and he should check behind a hand like QT K9 KT. does he limp 22? maybe, but thats only 1 combo because i have 2 of spades. anyway i decide thats its very likely he has JT or something like that and i decide to call with my pair.

&amp;#x200B;

**Results:**

**Player2 shows \[9d, Td \]**

**Hero shows \[2s, As \]**

**Hero wins $3.41 USD from main pot**

If it weren’t for the Mike Postle situation beginning to gain traction right around when Joey said he was back and wanted to start making more videos, the scandal itself wouldn’t have exploded as much, and neither would Joey’s fame. Joey should realize and appreciate the fateful timing and coincidence, and possibly question where Mike Postle would be now if it weren’t for his return to YouTube. For if all of this info came to light just a month or two earlier, then entire development of this scandal would be severely behind where it is now. Joey should also question his motives, and if he is really this absorbed because he thinks Mike is wrong, or because he was looking for something to fill his time with.

poker,Listening with your Teeth... Mike Postle and Thoughts on Bone Conduction Hearing.,"Does Postle typically play with a toothpick in his mouth? 

Doug Polk’s post which brought up bone conduction headphones reminded me of a trip I took to the Bahamas years back. 

I went scuba diving with an outfit that offered us “Headphones” for music while we were diving. 

It was a tiny rubber strip connected to your basic mouth piece for breathing. 

The sound was transmitted through your teeth, which are fused to your jaw bone. 

The sound was a little like listening through a tin can telephone. You could make out the words and music but it was all very much on the high end of the audio spectrum. No bass. 

So it turns out there are companies that make hearing aids - which are virtually undetectable visually, that you place on your back molars. 

[Hearing with your Teeth - Invisible Hearing AIDS ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/singularityhub.com/2010/01/29/new-hearing-aid-uses-your-tooth-to-transmit-sound/amp/)

Secondly: There are a number of DIY How To Videos on making these types of devices. 

Everyone seems fixated he must have had something hidden in his hat. Seems risky given the fact it could easily be spotted. 

Postle had a toothpick in his mouth for most of the tournament. At least while he’s in a hand. I haven’t analyzed other games- but does he normally sport a toothpick for an entire 4 hour game?

Micro-receivers made by Lectrosonics which operate on what’s called a Digital Hybrid frequency (they transmit both analog and digital signals over UHF and combine the signals for cable quality audio) are now small enough to where the internal components could easily be uncased and reassembled to fit in the back of the mouth where the molars end. 

These Lectros last 6-8 hours on a small lithium cell. 

They have audio out for headphones (line level) which is more than powerful enough to drive a bone conducting micro driver. 

THE INTERESTING THING about this setup is that the driver for the device (the actual headphone) can be EXTREMELY small because it directly touches actual bone- meaning a much lower impedance is required.

The devices that affix to a persons head must penetrate the skin first requiring a much higher audio level. 

On the scuba trip I was on the headphone you bit down on was like a “Ribbon” less than one mm thick. Imagine a 1 inch piece of flexible rubber/plastic that’s clear and see through. 

When you put it in your mouth and it touched your Teeth.... bam the music kicked in. Pretty crazy. 

Just another thought. Conspiracy Theory, some fuel for the fire."

poker,(1/3 live) Passive line vs over aggro tilter. Too thin to river shove?,"Played this hand versus a villain who was on his second buyin. He dusted his first off in a 3 way all in on a AJxxx where a different player won with AQ. Villain was the one who shoved so he had at best AT, which seems to be a clear case of overvaluing his hand strength. He rebought and seemed tilted - straddling every time he could and vpiping 40-60%, doing a lot of limp/calling pre and betting too much on the flop. Generally playing too many hands.

Table dynamic in general was passive with preflop frequently going limp limp raise $15, call,call etc. Hero has been card dead for about 45 minutes, havent pfr at any point during that time.

The hand:

Limped to hero in hijack with AQo, bets to $20 to isolate. Tilted V in cutoff calls and everyone else folds. V is effective stack at ~230.

Flop(~$50): A72r
H checks, V bets $20, H calls.

I usually cbet here on a super dry A high flop but I decide to check since V could go off with 7x and pocket pairs. I'm not afraid of any turn cards, either. Also I figured the odds of him spazzing out with a low equity bluff are pretty good, especially since ""I cant have an ace since I checked the flop""

Turn ($90) 4r

H checks, V bets $35, H calls

Badugi, dry board, so I just flatted. I'm pretty underrepped here, I could probably raise in this spot and was planning to if a flush or obvious straight draw came in.

River ($160): 3x (A7243)

H checks, V bets $60, H calls

4 to a straight so i didn't have the balls to river shove here. In retrospect, 5x is tough to find in Vs range but during play I thought he'd have at least some like A5, 55, 75s. He only had ~100 behind so it's not that big of a reraise. Still I felt I would get called by 2pair and straights and probably everything else folds.

River is a 6, he throws out 100, i put him all in for 145. He calls and has 8-9 suited. Not worried about the outcome, however at any point were my bets out of place? Or maybe do i just flat the river?"

poker,Lose preflop call cracks my aces,"So I had this hand the other day and was wondering wheter my call on the river was justified or just out of tilt. 

I (230BB) get dealt Aces in the CO (6 handed .02/.05 zoom), UTG (130BB) opens to .10, I 3bet to .30 folds back to him and he calls.
flop comes Qd Jd 4h. He checks it over to me I bet 2/3 pot he calls. Turn is the 10s. He checks it over to me, I bet a bit over half pot, he calls.
River is the 3d. He shoves for 140% of the pot. I call he showes Kd 8d and wins.
Now my thinking: I had the A of diamonds. Therefor to me the chances of him having a reasonable flush are almost zero. Kd 10d was about the only combo i could imagine, but i would raise flop or turn with that. AK would 4bet pre. Other reasonable hands that beat me are JJ, QQ and 10 10, but 10 10 should fold flop, and i expect QQ and JJ to raise flop or turn, but never to shove river because I have a high possibility to have AK.
I didnt think he would bluff in this spot, but I saw no hands he should have here that beat me.
Could/should I have gotten away from this?"
poker,How to play College Poker,"So my college does poker nights on Wednesdays, tournament €5 buy in. The people there are all novices(call stations who play lots of hands). I've gone both weeks (only been on twice) and lost, playing only good hands and never bluffing. We start with 50Blinds and they go up fairly quickly. Whats the most profitable way to play this kind of game? So far I've been limping all the shit hands (limping is the norm here) and raising 5BB my good hands and getting value when i hit. However because the blinds go up so quickly I end up getting to the push shove stage fairly soon and thats where I go bust. How can I make the most money possible at this kind of game? Thanks!"

My question is, was any legal action taken against Hamilton (civil or criminal) and if not, was it due to lack of evidence or was it because there is/was no law covering cheating online or some sort of jurisdictional thing also because of it being done online and/or in Canada or something?

As far as I know he admitted to it on tape and also the investigation showed he was involved and the primary beneficiary. I think he has the distinction of being one of the biggest thieves in history whose identity is known to get off without any penalty -- he did not have to flee the country or change his identity. I know he is afraid to show his face among poker players but it's not like he needs to play poker anymore."

poker,Ultimate Bet Superuser,"Just finished watching about an hours worth of hands from the infamous super user 'PotRipper' on Ultimate Bet and the similarities between how 'PotRipper' played and how Mike Postle is playing is uncanny.

Folding strong hands when beat and losing the minimum, making crazy bluffs in weird spots with marginal holdings or complete air and always being right unless someone makes a crazy hero call, playing a losing style of poker yet crushing the whole community. Vpip of about 80% yet wins every hand and rarely loses. Knows exactly when to bet and fold. 

Guess the only thing Mike isnt doing is open folding his hands pre flop when he knows someone is strong. For example Potripper would openly fold KQo when someone woke up with strong hands in later positions  preflop and would not even bother playing if more than a couple people had premium holdings."

poker,[1/2 Live] I just made the fold of the century and I need to share it with someone,"I am UTG with Q4o. Normally this is a snap fold for me but I am at a quite fishy table and I don't want to fold this hand in position (at least vs the BB and SB which are super mega fish). I want to raise but am afraid to get re-raised; also, this is the perfect hand to trap because if someone raises and I 3bet, they'll put me on AA 100% of the time. Meaning I can easily shove the flop except if the flop is super coordinated and get a lot of folds.

I limp and sure enough, moron on BTN raises to $8 (two limps before). SB and BB calls, so I snap raise to $20. Only BTN and BB call, which is good because I now have half-position.

Flop comes Qc 9c 6s which is good for me. No clubs or spades in my hand. I bet $5 as a tester bet, thinking I'll 3bet if someone raises. Sure enough, moron on button (it rhymes, do you get it?) makes it $10 and I make it $20. BB folds, BTN makes it $40, clearly a game of chicken. I look at him in the eyes: who will break first? Who will chicken out? Well, me. At this point, I pretty much put him on AQ and AQ only. I call.

Turn comes Qc 9c 6s 4s which is my money card. I bet $5 again and sure enough, he raises to $10. No point raising anymore here so I call to trap.

River comes Qc 9c 6s 4s 4d which is terrible for me. I bet $5 as a blocker bet thinking he might be scared to raise, but to my surprise, he snap all-in ($45 more). While the pot ratio is good, I know he has QQ. What else could he have? Nothing. So he has QQ.

I make a tight fold and sure enough, he shows QQ. I show my hand and I think he gets genuinely impressed. ""Wow, nice fold. You're a great poker player!"" he says, unironically. The woman at the table winks at me, or perhaps she had something in her eye, but I know she is interested. Too bad she's a good 20 years older than me. 

I might have lost the hand, but I have kept my dignity. I leave the table with a smile. I lost my stack, but I won the respect of all players at the table. A dealer on break smiles as me as I cash my remaining $45. As I reflect on how far I progressed as a poker player, I reward my amazing fold with a lobster + champagne at the casino's restaurant, which coincidentally cost $45 exactly, with tips and taxes. My poker skills basically got me a free lobster meal."

poker,"Hypothetically, do Postle’s victims have any recourse?","My bad if this has already been covered, but the one thing I’ve been thinking about while watching Joey’s streams is what the consequences are if hard evidence is actually gathered that proves Postle was cheating. I haven’t read California’s laws, but Postle has to be liable under some statute in a world where Ivey can be sued for edge sorting (obviously, the amount at stake in that case is far greater and I’m sure Borgata had a fantastic legal team, but still). 

A) Can Stones sue Postle?

B) Can players who lost to Postle sue Postle?

I’d guess that A has a greater likelihood than B even though the players are the ones who are actually harmed in this fiasco (though I’m sure Stones could make a case that their reputation takes a hit or something). I think the most likely scenario is that Postle is just simply banned and this never goes to court if no concrete evidence is gathered, which I don’t think there will be. It just makes me angry that people lost thousands upon thousands to this guy who was almost certainly cheating and there’s really nothing that’s going to be done about it.

poker,"18 players hyperturbos bounties, final table hand","I don't have hand history, but it's simple; 6 players on the table, top 3 pays ($70, $70, $50), and bounties are $12 so first player makes another $24 more (the 2 bounties).

I have 4 bb on the small blind, the 2 players to my left have 5bb, and to my right have 1, 0.5, and 2bb. The blinds just increased, so we should get to the money without another blind increase.

The 2bb guy folds, and the other two (0.5bb and 1bb guys) shoves. 

Question is, what's my shoving range here?

I have a decent shot at making the money (being 3rd in chips) but it's not guaranteed. If a shorty double up, he'll be close (with antes and stuff).

I'd obviously like to get the $24 of bounties for just 1bb, but I'm concerned about the player to my left, who will see $36 of bounties on the table, and know that I might be shoving super light, and I'm the only stack that matters to him (like he's the only stack that matters to me, if I win against him I don't care if I lose vs the 2 shorty).

In the hand in question, I shoved, BB reshoved and I lost, so I might be a bit result oriented (hence why my question is more about what range you'd shove here, rather than my specific hand)."

* Little ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hPmOpd_wBs))
* Polk + Ingram ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuBerIx8e1M))

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR. I think he's just a fish on a heater.

&amp;#x200B;

Mike obviously knows how to play poker, I mean he's been playing for 16 years. He seems to be pretty damn good a reading hands (blockers + betting patterns) and scenarios (position + texture), and he's not afraid to bet big (or make big calls) when he has a draw to the nuts + fold equity.

He's LAG when he's on any draw (or misses) and OMC when he actually has it. The thing is, he rarely has it but neither do his opponents. Every hand that I've seen as evidence, he has just super aggro/ sticky when on a draw (usually a gutshot) where his opponent happens to miss too. He's also aggro when obvious draws miss, like the flush draw, etc. Then the times he does have it, his opponents do just as insane plays as he does, except he has the nuts. 

He's also fishy/sticky/gambler when he invests money into a pot - like his very questionable call with 45o vs AK vs AK. He was UTG+1 and re-straddled to $45. There were 2 calls then the SB raised to $245 (5.5x) and the BB 3-bet to $705 (2.8x reraise or 15.6 bb). Even if you know that they both have AK, it's not a clear cut call, it's still a bad call - but he's already put in $45, has position on both players, might think the other players behind are dead money, and maybe thinks he'll outplay them just like all the other videos show him do, fishy call even if you know they both have AK. But he calls, and then it folds back to the SB who goes all-in for $2900 (64 bb) then BB goes all-in for $4100 (91 bb) now the pot is $7805 and he has to call $3395 more (76 bbs) getting 2.3-to-1 now with no action behind him. So now he needs to be 30% to make the call, and with a pot this big they are likely going to run it twice which means he needs even less to make the call. 

A look at the odds of 45o VS:

* AK v AK = 42%
* AK v AQ = 32%
* AK v JJ = 18%
* AA v KK = 15%
* AA v AA = 18%

&amp;#x200B;

He's just getting lucky at the right time. He's on a god run, a Jamie Gold + Darvin Moon run of cards, situations, run outs, position, etc... a ""Gold Moon"" run of cards.

poker,Hand Review $1-2-5,"Playing $1-2-5 live. Hero stack at \~$400. Average stack around $3-400 except two whales with $1000. Button straddles pre to $10, SB folds, BB shoves for \~$70. Fold to UTG+2 who reshoves for around $200. Folds to hero who looks down at KK. Hero calls. 

Initially upon review, I thought I should have reshoved to deny equity, but then again, who would call with anything less than AA to a shove, reshove, and a call. Button then shoves and has hero covered. I know at least one of the 3 other players has Aces, but in that scenario, theres no way I can fold here with all that dead money, so I call. We also all agree to run it twice. First runout has an Ace and all low cards. Second runout we hit our K. BB mucks, UTG+2 folds Queens, I show Kings and Button shows Aces. Hero and BU chop and we both profit a little over $100. 

After the hand was over, the player to my left and another player two to the right both start talking about how that was a bad play by me, that i should have folded Kings there. While I can see the validity of folding once the Button shoved, there was no way I was going to fold to two short stacks with Kings. Once he shoves, there was over $1000 in the pot and I had a little more than 200 behind. The button shoving really fucked me, but I just don't think I can get away from it at that point. Also, the Button could have been making a hell of a play by shoving over me, forcing me to fold with something less than Aces. Not saying thats likely, but a possibility. 

Other than reshoving immediately, I don't think there's anything else I could have done."

I'm sitting in the straddle with 5h 4c, and I have a very good read on my opponents. Thinking I have good equity against their ranges I flat in position. It folds around to the SB who decides to jam for his remaining 2.7K. The big blind snaps in his last 4.1K and I'm left with my 54o with a decision to make. What do I beat here? I'm flipping against deuces and 3's, but in bad shape against a lot of hands. 

All of a sudden I have an epiphany, what if both my opponents have AK? Seems reasonable enough, so I make the call. Since I figure I'm behind we agree to run it twice.

poker,A few 1/3 hands,"A few quick hands I recently played that I want to get the community's thoughts on.


Some background:


V1: absolute mega fish. Will raise with trash and call 3bets with garbage. Loves to play to the end of the hand if he has any piece of the board or a draw. 


On an earlier hand he raised with 86s over 2 limpers OTB to 25, got a caller from one of the tightest players in the SB, i made it 75 with AcAs in BB (sizing okay?), get called in 2 spots and SB shoves for 25 more so we all call. Flop is J59ccd and i jam for ~250 more, he tank calls with a gutter and no FD and bricks out. 


In another hand he raised A9dd UTG (deep like 1.5k behind) and gets called by 4 people, flop is 855ddx, he bets 30, gets raised to 75, then the SB jams for ~300, and he rejams and gets called by the original raiser with 53o (lol). SB had 88 and scooped. 


Basically he is not afraid to GII way behind and I have been exploitatively sizing up my 3bets for value and have not been 3betting light since he doesn't have a fold button pre. 


V2: solid TAG, old asian guy but doesn't get too out of line. I have seen him overvalue Top pair mid kicker and overbet jam on the flop with things like QJo on Q75 rainbow but that was also against V1 so he may not do that sort of thing against more competent opponents. 


I am one of the tighter players but do 3bet more than most, so I am probably viewed as aggressive.


Anyways, on to the hands:


#1: one of the first hands of the night. Effective stacks around 350

folds to V1 who raises to 11 OTB. V2 calls in the SB and i 3bet to 60 with black KK.

V1 calls, and we see a flop with ~125 in the middle.

Flop is Q77ccx

I bet 60 and he folds. 

Wondering if I should check here and let him try to bet me off? I would likely check my AA, QQ, 77 combos, bet AQ and KQ and KK for a little bit of protection but mainly value against possible flush draws and weaker pairs. 


#2: Soon after H1. Effective stacks are closer to 300

V1 straddles for 6 UTG, V2 calls, i make it 26 with AKo, only V1 and V2 call. 

Flop is J34 rainbow

I Cbet 30, V1 calls and V2 jams for his remaining ~275. 

Snap fold?


#3: This is late in the night, I have been card dead for about an hour so haven't played a hand.

2 limpers then V1 makes it 20 OTB with ~1800 behind, gets called by a drunk and very tilted guy with ~150 in SB, i 3bet to 100 with AsKs (450 behind) in the BB and get called by 1 limper, V1, and drunk guy.

Flop (~400) is Qs9s5c

Drunk guy shoves for ~50, i rejam for 450. 

Thoughts on this shove? I thought it was pretty much my only move here. 


#4: This hand happens immediately following hand 3. I have about 630 in my stack now. V1 is around 1800 still. V2 at about 700. 

V2 from earlier limps in EP, V1 makes it 16 in MP, i call OTB with K4ss, one of the blinds calls and V2 calls. 

Flop (~58) is KdQc5s

 V1 bets 40, I call and V2 calls. Planning to continue on spades, a 4, or another K. 

Is this too loose? My reasoning here is that I will definitely get paid if I hit my backdoor flush/2pr and he can be value betting worse, or just betting air. 

Turn (~175) is the 4d

V1 bets 85, i raise to 240, V2 folds, and V1 jams for my remaining 336. 

Fist pump call, sigh call, sigh fold?

I'll post results in a few hours. Thanks!



Results:

H2: I snap fold, V1 folds, V2 triumphantly tables JTo

H3: Everyone else folds, drunk guy has Q4o and I don't improve

H4: I call. V has KQo and I don't improve"
poker,Regarding Cheating in Poker,"Warning: I'm about to make some bold claims and have zero evidence as this occurred over ten years ago and I no longer have my hand databases. I am not going to spend much time in this thread beyond this post, I may not reply at all. I will not reveal my poker aliases or go into much more detail than I provide here. I expect most people to think what I say is all lies, that is the typical response. Maybe you've experienced similar things, maybe not, the point is that you should be very careful with who you trust in the world of gambling and never close your mind to the possibility that you may be being cheated. As for me, through a combination of poor spending habits and generosity, the majority of my money is gone and I am no longer playing high stakes, very few would even recognize me.

I'll preface this by saying that I have won a very large amount of money playing online poker and a bit playing live. During my career, I noticed a lot of extremely bizarre activity online and basically everyone with high-level poker knowledge would always discredit my suspicions of certain poker sites being rigged. No matter how damning my anecdotes were, nobody believed me. **A lot of this happened during a period in time in which the average skill level was dramatically lower than what you see today. A $50 NL 6max solid win rate pro today would be crushing high stakes back in the day. The games were so different they are almost not comparable.**

Since then we've seen quite a few scandals and people are finally realizing that a lot of corrupt shit goes on. People believe wholeheartedly that major poker sites are legit because some supposed authorities that none of us can verify are honorable are regulating these sites, therefor they're legit. That is not how the world works. When there is big money at stake people will try as hard as possible to steal it if they think they can get away with it. The fact is that the vast majority of the online poker community has no proof the sites are legitimate.

Without making this too longwinded I'll list a few anomalies I experienced, all of which were disregarded and I was accused of having selective memory. I will note that I have not experienced these types of anomalies in recent years, they occurred during the height of my career when I was quite dominant and was actively eliminating entire pools of cash game players. For example, before I arrived at $30/$60 limit holdem on one site, the games were thriving and action was always available, I took so much money that after a while there was nobody playing these stakes and this was on a major site. I did the same thing at $100/$200, which was the highest stakes for limit hold'em at that time.

9 tabling $1/$2 to $3/$6 NLH over a three month period my win rate was literally double the next biggest winner. All of a sudden I began getting coolered by quads every day, one to five times, for 29 consecutive days. I played roughly two to ten hours per day. Again, I was coolered and I was a HUGE nit because people were so passive back then to the point where it was extremely obvious what most players were doing in big pots.

Another time I lost AIPF with QQ vs AK twenty times in a row. During that same time period, I had a similar losing streak with AK vs QQ.

In an uncounted but large amount of hands, likely in the neighborhood of thirty, I defended my BB vs button with KQ, flopped top pair and had the losing hand every time.

These are just a few of the strange occurrences I can recall. **In recent years my volume is admittedly lower and my skill edge is not even remotely close to what it once was, but I never see anything strange like this these days. I suspect that now that poker data and knowledge is so widely available that formerly corrupt sites are now legit or close to it. However, we will never know until there is a major exposure of corruption.**

I'd like to point out that limit hold'em used to be the most popular game and it was actually a LOT of fun. Eventually, people suspected they were playing against bots and the majority of people didn't believe it, but it turned out to be true. Now limit hold'em is basically dead online. This is just one example from the past of cheating turning out to be real. There have been superuser accounts that were abused, and likely a lot of collusion, probably illegal software offering GTO solutions during play, etc. It will only get worse."

Sitting ~$600, covering rest of the table. 7 handed

Limps Hero in LP with QhQd, raises it up to $16. SB (~$350) calls and guy to my direct right(~$500) calls. 3 ways to the flop

SB is a loose donk who loves to gamble
Guy to my right is a decent thinking player

Flop is AdKsJs

SB bets $20, we both make the call

Turn Qs [AdKsJsQs]

SB bets $55, we both call again

SB open jams the rest of his stack. Guy to my right thinks for a little and calls. I think for a little, thinks of the hands that beat me and the only likely hands would be KJ or KQ given the action and I double block KQ (AA, KK, AK should have raised me pre). He could also have a flush or maybe even a T if he just doesn’t believe the SB. I decide to just stick the rest in and the guy to my right calls pretty quickly. We all table our hands and we all have full houses. SB has AhKc and guy to my right has KhQc. 
Any thoughts on how this hand was played? It’s just a massive cooler I think, no way to not lose the max."

MP1 calls, CO calls and SB calls. MP has been playing a wider range, while CO and SB have been playing not nearly as many hands. Flop comes 10 10 Q rainbow. SB checks, I bet $1 and only the CO calls. I have about 8.20 behind at this point, and the Villain has about 5.20. I like this flop a lot, as the CO has been playing fairly tight to he has a lot of Qx here and not a lot of 10’s. Could be drawing, but I haven’t seen him chase a draw yet tonight. With the pot at about $4, Turn comes a brick(4s?), completes the rainbow, and i again lead for $2 and then the villain shoves his remaining 5.20. Hero?

Villain has a little bit of a wider range, since someone called my raise in front of him. Some 10’s can get there, 10 9, J10, A 10, but I feel like he has more queens here. AQ, KQ, JQ, Q10 are all combos he can has. It’s probably a bad move, but I elect to call and he  turn over Q10 off, and I’m crushed.

poker,Comprehensive 6-max Cash Course Reviews,"Hello everyone. I've taken quite a few 6-max cash game courses: Namely Red Chip's ""Core"", Upswing Poker Lab, Run It Once's ""From The Ground Up"" and I believe I have good insights on the quality of all 3. Here are my reviews.

**Red Chip Core:**

This course is extremely bare bones basic. It covers everything from the most basic math and gradually gets into some beginner GTO concepts. If you are a hard core newbie, this is honestly probably the best course for you as it will give you a picture of all the topics to be studied in poker. It is not in my opinion, enough to form a complete strategy, and I can't say if its even enough to get you beating microstakes on some of the American sites (American sites are universally harder than the European sites) but this course is so cheap at 5$ a week and honestly a massive steal for the sheer amount of content they give you. If you are an intermediate player, a lot of the content will be extremely boring and will be sometimes painful to watch so I highly suggest liberally skipping some of the modules but there is still tons of value to get out of the later modules and the hand reviews.

**From The Ground Up:**

If red chip irritated me by being too basic at times, From The Ground up might irritate others by ramping up in complexity far too quickly. This course covers (in my opinion) all the core GTO concepts needed for a complete strategy and to beat the microstakes. My advice to any new player is to purchase this course alongside a solver or something like Pokersnowie as it will go hand in hand with this course and greatly enhyance your learning and understanding. More-over after the course does a hand breakdown, you're able to verify it with a solver and run other examples that are similar to further solidify the concept. Overall, I would rate this as one of the best courses as Peter Clarke (the coach) explains things really well and for only 50$ this course is an absolute steal for the quality and amount of content.

**Upswing Lab:**

sigh, I had much higher expectations for this course and was extremely disappointed. I'm not by any means saying that the lab is bad, if anything it might be the most organized and has one of the most cohesive teaching styles out of all of the three. My problem is with the content itself. The Upswing Lab can be broken down into three modules:

1. Core Strategy
2. Beyond Core
3. Play and Explains

**Core Strategy:** This content is certainly good for an absolute newbie. My problem is that a lot of the content taught in this module is at extreme odds with modern solver study and modern GTO. They teach rules like ""Never Slow Play a category 1 strong hand as a pre flop aggressor"" but I just don't think this is a good rule to teach newbies as it is not only debunked in later modules but will lead to beginners picking up bad habits of overplaying top pairs out of position as a PFR and having too weak of a check-raising range. The simple fact is that even at the microstakes, a solid theoretical understanding of basic GTO concepts is required. We no longer live in the age of ""Play exploitatively and save GTO for higher stakes."" I think that a lot of the core strategy content is severely outdated and features Doug breaking things down in Equilab and talking about balance, not in an absolute sense but in a creative sense which was honestly great 3 or 4 years ago. If concepts like polarization and balance are completely foreign to you, then this might help but I found the core strategy to be a little misleading. Sure, you could make the argument that core strategies should be beginner friendly but it certainly isn't hard to tell newbies that sets should be checked out of position as PFR occasionally and that turns should not always be C-bet just because you have a strong top pair. 

**Beyond Core:** This is generally good content but I also think that they heavily skimp out on GTO content and don't provide enough of a foundation to actually be a winning player online today. They have some great GTO videos for sure: specifically some videos with Matthew Janda. I just feel like they should have a lot more content related to solver based styles as the beginning content actually takes you so far away from a solver based style it might actually be damaging. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Play And Explains:** Great content. You're watching top players play and can see how it's done. I especially like that they include play and explains on American facing sites which are usually skimped out on. A+ for this section.

&amp;#x200B;

**Putting It All Together:**

Overall, I would say that Upswing has some of the best structured content but perhaps not the most modern or directly relevant to beating today's games. In terms of value for money, they are on the more expensive side and in hindsight, I wouldn't subscribe to it again.

Core is extremely price effective but annoyingly basic if you're already an intermediate player. I would recommend speed-running this course and slowing down only for the advanced modules. In particular: the ones made by the live players should be taken with a grain of salt as their content will be heavily outdated. The content made by Adam Jones is awesome however. 

From The Ground Up: this course ramps of really quick. If you've already taken core from red chip or made your way through Upswing Lab then this will be the perfect follow up. It's realistically mostly a GTO and theoretical based course with some good content on exploiting unbalanced players. Peter Clarke is currently beating midstakes on some of the tougher online sites and is more than qualified to discuss these concepts. However: this course might be hard to grasp without a solver"
poker,Unsure about this turn call,"This is at a $1/2 home game at my college's poker club so no rake. I've played with V a ton. He's an absolute maniac and calling station. I really can't stress how terrible of a LAG he is.

He opens from MP to $7 and the CU (who is a close poker friend of mine) flats. I 3b QQ to $31 from the BU and only V from MP calls.

The flop comes KJx rainbow and V checks to me. The only hands I'm ahead of that would call a cbet are AJ (12 combos) but KQ (6 combos) and KJ (9 combos) are certainly in his range so I opt to check.

The turn is a 6 adding a back door draw and V leads out for 2/3 pot and I call thinking that V can be doing this for value with AJ, backdoor draws and even a lot of air after I check back the flop. Ignoring the flush draws and air I still have 44% equity against his value range-- although 66 is probably in V's range which would bring that equity down to just 40%, while I only need ~28% required equity.

Am I going about the thought process on this turn correctly or am I overcalling here?"
poker,"Never played poker seriously, I wanna learn how to actually play, any good resources or places to learn?","Anything helps, this Friday I'm going to play at a friend of a friends house, and it's a game for beginners who don't know really how to play, I wanna learn to play at least somewhat decent before then."
poker,"[Live 1/3] I think one of the biggest leaks in my game is playing from waaaay ahead, especially after the flop","The title says most of it.  I've been running quite hot my last few sessions, but honestly, I feel like I should be making more than I have been.  Like, multiple hands of flopping the absolute nuts and then not being sure how to get maximum value out of it. Here are a couple examples:

1/3 game at MGM NH...if you know anything about this casino, you know that the games here have some of the softest players in the country.

It's like 10:30 PM, the table's active but no one's drunk or anything and so the game's been pretty reasonable as far as 1/3 live games go. My session has actually been up and down so far, but is about to be red hot for the next 2 hours or so.

V1 is a thinking TAG player, Asian online/silent type with headphones on but is clearly a step ahead of most of the table (and, honestly, probably a better player than I am).

H probably has a similar image to most people at the table, but is more fun to be around :D

Anyway, to the hands...

**Stacks/positions:**

V1: BU, $700ish

V2: BB, $82

H: UTG, $650ish

**Pre-flop:** ($4) H raises to $12 with ATcc, folds to V1 who raises to 50, folds to V2 who goes all-in for $82, H calls (action is capped after an incomplete raise, which is the only reason I even considered calling with V1 still behind), V1 calls.

**Flop:** ($247) Q96ccc H checks, V1 bets $100, H calls.

**Turn:** ($447, 200 on the side) 4c H ???

**My thoughts:**

Obviously, you hate to see the fourth club, but I'm equally hesitant to raise the flop when we've completely smashed it and have blockers to a lot of the hands that even consider continuing.  But what looks more suspicious here, checking or betting as if the fourth club doesn't scare me?

**Next Hand**

V1 IMMEDIATELY changes seats to two to my left.  I debate being a clown and switching to a seat to HIS left, but decide against it.  He loses a bit more, then gets up and leaves for maybe an hour, during which time I proceed to run over the table for a while.  Zero skill involved, I just get hit over the head with the deck.  At this point, I'm also in one of those moods where you just play whatever decent cards come your way because nothing seems to go wrong.  He comes back and...

**Stacks/positions:**

V1: BU, $400ish

H: HJ, $1700ish

**Pre-flop:** ($4) One or two limpers, H raises to $15 with 45hh, folds to V1 who raises to 45, folds around, H calls.

**Flop:** (~$100) 236xss H checks, V1 bets $50, H ???

**My thoughts:**

Obviously, with the spades out there, my hand is a little bit vulnerable, but how scared can I be?  I'm still thinking I need to extract value on the flop and lean toward a moderate raise, but very curious to hear discussion on this.  V1 is on MEGA TILT, if the description above didn't make that amply clear.

**Next Hand**

V1 actually table changes immediately after the hand above, so I can't remember if hand #3 is before or after #2, but it makes little difference.

**Stacks/positions:**

Effective stacks are like $750 at most, H is sitting around with something like $1500-1800 and is UTG

**Pre-flop:** ($4) H raises to $15 with 88cs, 4 callers including the blinds

**Flop:** ($75) 678r Blinds check, H checks, checks around to a V in late position who bets $35, folds to H, ???

**My thoughts:**

While it's rainbow, this board is juicy for all those middle connected cards that people tend to play for small raises at low-stakes live games, especially after there are 2 or 3 callers ahead of them.  I would be shocked if, out of the 6 people in the hand, someone didn't have something like 97o or 56o.  Again, I lean towards raising.


These weren't the only hands this session - I flopped multiple straights and flushes and had a handful of sets/boats throughout the night.  Obviously, there were plenty of hands where a fourth straight card or a fourth flush card came down and it made it more difficult to get value, but I just can't help but feel like I *should* have been extracting more.  I ended the night up ~$1700.  The biggest hand (and, I think the only time I got any reasonable stack all-in) was actually two-pair against someone's AK TPTK for ~250 BBs each.  Any general thoughts outside these hands would be appreciated, too.  Thanks!"

poker,(serious) how do you play against somebody who is incredibly LAG with position?,"Edit: I watched this player run like Jesus for the next 3hrs after he busted me. He ran like Jesus for 5 hours before his luck ran out and he busted in 16th. Deep run but I wasn’t too upset since he didn’t make the FT

For the last 2 hrs, I played against somebody, of course with position on me, who was habitually opening with overbets (7+BB), calling shoves with almost anything and and winning almost every hand because he was running like god.  Calling shoves with 56o, J9o, Q7o, T7o(won 3x with this), the list goes on.  I had an essay of notes on him because every hand he played got to showdown with hands much better than his preflop but he sucked out every time.  This lasted for 2hrs until I got it in good, on the button with ATs with him on the BB knowing he'd call anything.  I jammed my 30bb stack and he called with J9s but hit a jack on the flop and I didn't improve.  Maybe I shouldn't have shoved such a large stack and waited for a better hand but I wouldn't want to wait until I got QQ-AA because I literally couldn't do more than min raise without him jamming on top or 3betting to like 5x my raise.  The table was paralyzed and there wasn't much post flop action because he played everything and won everything.  Hands that miraculously saw a flop ended when he either jammed it or folded (rare).  How do I deal with this?  Let him steal my min raises, my blinds and wait for absolute premium hands?  I lasted for such a long time waited for a strong one against him and I knew I'd get called by a worse hand but ofc he hit on the flop. halppppp"
poker,Weird question about a hand and general strategy towards the end of an 8 our session at a home game.,"Played a 1/1 home game, and the action got progressively looser and the stacks got deeper as the alcohol kept flowing. A dude that started out as probably the best player at the table just got absolutely demolished and lost his 1k stack, and just kept buying in for 100 and punting it. We told him to stop and he was very insistent that he wanted to keep playing so whatever. Anyway, towards the end he was shoving pre every hand or shoving the flop if it wasn’t all in pre. Literally his range was all in every hand. Anyway, I got KsQs at one point, and wanted to play the damn thing. What the hell do you do in these spots? Like this just isn’t an all in shove hand, but it demolished his range. I ended up taking the route of folding everything that isn’t jacks+, and AQs+, and ended up just folding this decent hand because I knew he’d shove. 

In general, any advice for how to play against this sort of extreme? Just not sure what the best exploitative line might be."

poker,3-Bet/Fold strategy from EP.,"Hi r/poker.

I have been toying with a strategy and I've commented on some posts in this sub with thoughts regarding this strategy with very polarized feedback.  The question at hand is simple.  What do we do when we have a premium, but not super-premium, or an extremely playable hand in EP and we're facing an open raise (I'm talking about medium pocket pairs, suited broadways and medium strength Aces like AQ/AJ/AT).  The dilemma that I have discovered in spots like this is that, when we flat call, we create extremely good odds for additional players to force the pot to go multi-way and take position on us.  I hate finding myself in these spots, so I started dabbling with doing things a little differently.

I recalled that some players play a 3-bet/fold strategy from the SB and figured that a similar strategy could be used in the spot I'm referring to.  The only difference is that, since I will always have position on the original raiser, I use a smaller sizing (usually around 2.5x).  Of course, with a smaller sizing we are compelled to do this with a more linear range instead of a polarized one.

The merits to this strategy as I see them are as follows:

1. Players yet to act will not have as good of pot odds to take position.
2. The 3-bet re-opens betting to the original raiser which further discourages future players from flat calling since they are not closing the action and likely may be put in a tough spot if the original raiser decides to 4-bet.
3. Giving the original raiser the chance to 4-bet or call helps to narrow their potential range much better than just flat calling and having them remain uncapped 100% of the time.
4. 3-betting range makes it so that our hand is not face up when we 3-bet a monster from EP.

The only disadvantage that I see to this strategy is that we are frequently inflating the pot with a weaker holding than the original raiser but, given that we will often be able to isolate and play a pot in position with the betting initiative, I don't think that's such a terrible price to pay.  As long as we're disciplined enough not to value own ourselves against the stronger portion of V's flat calling range (like if we have AJ and he has AQ) then I think we come out ahead in the long run.

Tell me what you think.  Does anybody else already use this strategy?  What are the downsides to this strategy that I haven't already considered?

The feedback is much appreciated.  Thanks."

poker,Summary of Poker's 1% by Ed Miller,"[Cross posted](https://premiumpokertools.com/blog/summary-of-pokers-one-percent) on [Premium Poker Tools](https://premiumpokertools.com/).

\---

Pokers 1% is all about frequency-based play. What is frequency based play? I think it's best understood in contrast to hand-strength-based play.

Consider an example. The board is A44r. Your opponent cbets. What hands do you continue with?

A nitty opponent might think:

&gt;Meh, 22 and 53 really just aren't strong enough for me to continue. But I guess I'd be cool peeling a street off with TT.

A more straightforward opponent might think:

&gt;This is a super dry board. I normally wouldn't like small pocket pairs and naked gutshots without anything else going for them, but in this case I guess I'd call with them. I wouldn't have the balls to call with king high though.

Now, watch how frequency-first approach would work:

&gt;I need to defend with 70% of my hands here. I've studied this spot before and I know that I only have about 45% pair or better hands. So I definitely need to continue with my backdoor flush draws. Probably a few king highs as well.

Do you see the difference?

* The hand-strength-first approach looks at the board, and asks what hands are strong enough to play on that board.
* The frequency-first approach first asks what frequency they want to continue at, and then asks what hands they want to select to meet that frequency.

That's the big idea in this book. To use the frequency-first approach.

poker,Folding middle set? Can I ever fold?,"1/2 NL $500 eff, straddle pot one limps to me in EP and I call with pocket 4s. SB, BB complete and straddle checks his option and 5 of us go to the flop 

8 4 2 2spades. Checks to me and I bet $15. Only SB calls. 

Turn comes offsuit 10. V checks and I bet $45 and he check-raises all in for $470~. Villian is a old chinese guy and is pretty nitty from what I've seen in one hour of play. Can I fold here considering the huge overjam? No other hand made sense besides pocket 2s, pocket 8s or pocket 10s. 8 10? I don't think he would overjam with 8 10. I ultimately make the call and he has pocket 8s and I get stacked. 

Everyone on the table was so surprised that I was close of even folding pocket 4s but no other hands really made sense. I would've faced a PF raise with overpair and I don't see him ever over jamming with a combo draw or something like A 10 of spades. Thoughts? I told myself that if I ever get set over set, I'm stacking of 99% of the time but I've never been this close of folding middle set on a dry board."

poker,WPN theft and BOTS (ACR),"Taken from 2+2

To those that are unaware, the past year has been an absolute disaster for players on the Winning Poker Network. I will attempt to accurately break down the timeline of events from my perspective over the past year.

November 2018

While playing a large number of hands competing in the beast I began to notice that many of the accounts from the former Eastern Bloc countries had identical postflop stats, especially stats that differed drastically from those of regulars outside of these countries. I had always been suspicious of these accounts because of their strange tendencies postflop but I had always seen a difference in preflop stats and I didn't realize that these were just adjustments to the rake level the bots were stationed at. I started to sift through my database and lo and behold when I checked 2 stats in particular all of these accounts stood out from the rest. They are: Flop cbet(multiway) and Flop Float (bet vs missed cbet in HEM). Their multiway flop cbetting is higher than heads up and their flop float is over 75% on average. Many of the 6max PLO games had 2-4 of these bots simultaneously. I started to collect names of these accounts as well as their other stats and sent the information to WPN security immediately. I then talked to a known poker pro that referred me to WINNING_TD who I spoke with on the phone. He told me that since none of the accounts I suspected to be bots were in the USA that it was impossible for any of the accounts to be bots. This obviously was not an acceptable outcome for me so I decided to contact Joe Ingram and he said he would love if I provided him with the data on these bot accounts. I did some research on the pokerstars/party PLO cash botring from 2016 and these accounts had the same postflop tendencies as well as some of the same preflop tendencies such as preflop squeeze being higher than preflop 3bet from every position and at every stake. I created a 2p2 account and began sharing the data on a few threads. No bots were banned.

April 2019
Twitch streamer ""EricCollier"" was playing a NL MTT and I was watching. He made it to heads up versus an account from Latvia called ""FoxRox"". FoxRox entered HU very deep and proceeded to tank and fold preflop almost every single hand versus a minraise and open fold the button. This was clearly a bot that somehow malfunctioned and was obvious to all viewers. The video went viral and there were many posts about it on various social media outlets.

In the days that followed this FoxRox incident, WPN CEO Phil Nagy went on a media blitz with many interviews and videos where he acknowledged that there was a bot problem and vowed that he would finally once and for all crack down on the bots and refund players $25,000 per bot that was banned based on how much they lost to the bot as an overall percentage and a convoluted structure based on what position they were in in games that the MTT bots cashed in. 

In the month after the FoxRox incident, 46 accounts were banned and added to this page https://www.winningpokernetwork.com/banned-accounts/. 
Many of the refunds went to other suspected bot accounts. The last group of banned accounts was added to this page on May 15th.


May 20th 2019

-WPN changes previous IGNsoft client to software that was previously used for their jackpot poker games. Players experienced numerous issues such as: pressing the enter key triggering a bet inadvertently, login not working, accounts not being recognized entirely and deleted from the WPN database, funds diasppearing from tables, extreme lag, crashes, disconnects, forced logouts, ect. Rake race leaderboards diappeared entirely and both VIP and flat rakeback payments completely stopped as well as deposit bonuses for months. Bots were gone for a few days but quickly returned. Hand histories are not being generated for all in situations at cash and MTTs.

July 2019

The VIP program was promised to be restored on July 10th, however on July 9th, the date was pushed back to a later unspecified date. Some of the glitches were fixed but many remained and still remain to this date. Bot situation continued to worsen at PLO cash but most tables still had only 1 bot max and only a couple tables would have 2 bots on certain days and times. Hand histories are not being generated for all in situations at cash and MTTs.

August 2019


Some VIP rakeback was paid but not the correct amounts. Bot situation begins to seriously worsen, one bot was seen winning the beast with the overall top place one week and many tables having 2 bots. Players report being shortchanged on flat rakeback payouts and affiliates report not being paid. Hand histories are not being generated for all in situations at cash and MTTs.

September 2019

Bot situation goes full out insane with almost every table during peak hours and especially on Fridays (the last day of the Beast race) having sometimes almost 90% of PLO200 and lower having 2-4 bots on it. Rank points and their equivalent are being shortchanged over 50%. Flat rakeback players are reporting not receiving any rakeback and even negative rakeback, or being shortchanged massively. Hand histories are not being generated for all in situations at cash and MTTs.


Spreadsheet of some bot accounts for selected stats from Feb 2019:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets...Jj9dj4DSPc8h4E

92 PLO bot accounts playing the exact same postflop stats over the past couple years which only 4 have been banned to date (most of these accounts are no longer active but only 4 have officially been banned and ""refunded"") There are many new bot accounts currently active playing this same profile.

poker,5th Final table in 2-3 weeks (pokerstars),"Only small stakes $1.10 HORSE game this time, so that prize pool is a little smaller (140 players).  
I really do like these variant games, shame not many people play them as they help with other aspects of your game.   


Came 3rd, got it in bad in Stud twice, straight vs a hidden flush (he got there with the last card) then 2 pair vs a straight... Kinda unlucky but I'm glad I've made this final table, was a fun little tourney to end the night on.   


Stud is probably my weakest sadly, Hi/Lo variant even more so.   


You'd think 3rd is decent, but its a break even for me today, just ran bad in earlier tournaments... But hey, it's a positive."

poker,Is this a bad call?,"At our home game, 5cent/10cent. Late position raises 40, I look down at 77 and call. Small blind raises it to 2.50, and then late position shoves. He has me covered, is this a shove? I have about 4.30 behind."
poker,The community on Van Island,"I'm curious as to what the community is like on Vancouver Island. Mostly the Nanaimo area but also the Victoria area on weekends. Played consistently in Alberta and will be legal here in a couple of months and just wanna know where the most action is n' stuff before I start playing again. Home games, casinos, etc. Have heard it's pretty lame out here but I'm hoping someone will say that isn't true. TIA :-)"
poker,Does the Min-Cashing in online MTT’s ever end!,"I keep min cashing in the Poker Stars Hot/Big 5.50$ and below. Same with other buy-ins, up to the 11$ Sunday Storm. I’m sure I’ve only played about 100-200 tourneys the past couple months but seems like I must be due for a cash that’s more than 3-4x my buy in lol

I dunno, guess I’m just looking to hear if anyone else had this problem for a while before a decent cash in these micro MTT’s. Anything to help my morale! Lol 

And I’m not new to the game , got live cash and tourneys under my belt. Just new to grinding these online MTT’s."
poker,"Flop Kh2s8s, I have KcQc, opponent's cards face up are AsQs, he shoves. I have to call correct?","Sanity check.

In the actual situation I panicked and folded. :/ (It was one of my first hands of the night and I was just there for a bit and didn't want to end my session early even if I was the probable winner of the hand--and in my confused state I actually forgot! whether I was the probable winner.)

But that's a snap call, right? If I'm holding KcQc, there's 165 in the pot, I have 200 in chips, opponent covers me, flop comes Kh2s8s and opponent literally turns over his cards to show AsQs and shoves, I have to call right? Because he only wins about a third of the time?

This opponent spent the whole night scaring people that he was ""on a draw"" and getting people to fold better-but-weak hands. I reminded myself that ""on a draw"" means you don't have anything, but never got a chance to really get it in with him after the described hand."

poker,"Bubble play, &lt; 10 bbs",Last night I was a extremely low stack (~9bbs) on the bubble. I typically jam &lt;15 somewhat wide IP but couldn’t seem to find the cards to do so. Another short stack (12bbs) raises to 3x from EMP at blinds 1250-2500. I found this sizing very strong considering his stack size but I still ended up jamming AQo from the BB when it folds to me. Is this a loose 3 bet shove by me? Certainly AQ is fine &lt;10 bigs but here it seemed weak..
poker,"$20 Live mTT, AK UTG, all in on the flop","Hi, I'm a fairly new poker player, and just started going to some live tournaments at my local pub. The players at these mtts tend to be calling stations, so I've been tightening my range and increasing my bet sizes. Here is one hand I just played through:

Blinds are 2k/4k.
Avg stack approx 100k.

Hero: 85k stack, UTG.

Villain : approx 300k stack( Maybe more, I didn't really check. BB.
Just got moved to the table so no reads on him.

**Preflop**: Hero UTG with [Ad](/Ad)[Kd](/Kd)

Hero raises to 12k, folds to villain in BB who calls.

**Flop**: [Td](/Td)[7d](/7d)[6c](/6c)

Villain raises 14k, Hero shoves, villain calls (""I'll have a look"").



My thoughts:

- When he raised the flop, I put him on either A+pair off, or a bluff with QJ, KJ, etc. So I thought if I shoved then he'll fold.

- I can see now that I didn't really have fold equity against such a big stack.

- Because of my preflop raise UTG, he probably tagged me as having AA, OR KJ etc, and also missing the flop.

- What other play could I make that would make sense?"

poker,Beginners question about call/raise,"So I have been reading the grinders manual and have come to the realisation that my vpip is too high. Having considered this I have looked into it a little and hear is how I understand it. 

6 max nlhe a vpip/pfr should be around 20/18.   This says to me that this player is hardly ever going to call instead of raise so clearly I'm calling far to many I'm around 33/14.

The problem I'm having is distinguishing between a call and a 3 bet pre flop. When is it right to 3 bet and when is it right to just flat?"
poker,How can I get better at knowing when to stop?,"One of the biggest leaks in my game is seemingly playing too long. I'll play solid for a couple of hours, dialed in and focused, making good decisions and often doubling up or better and then I'll stay at the table because it's going well and just run into it or getting sucked out on the river and I sigh and leave with a small profit or even (or down of course). 

So yeah, has anyone got any advice at knowing when to get out ahead or is it simply a case of that I need to improve my self discipline?"
poker,Sometimes it's just not your night,"Last night I got some pretty bad luck. I was feeling pretty good, felt like all the cards were falling my way. Felt I was making some good decisions and avoiding giving away my money. Then this happens.

I get pocket 9's, calls around to me where I raise 3BB. I get 1 guy who calls. Flop comes and I get a 9, 4s, 7h. I have three of a kind and the high card. I raise again expecting a quick fold. They call. Next card comes and it's a Js.

I am sitting there and just thinking, why would he call that. So I raise up to 2/3 of my stack. Call again. And the river, 10s. Check around and he flips over 2 spaids, he has a flush. I just sit there wondering why they called my initial raise when they had nothing at the time and needed 2 spaids for a flush. Whatever, I moved on.

Literally the next hand, I get a 10h and Jh. Calls all around and on the flop we get 4s4hQh. Checks all around here, and on the river another heart. I have a flush, so I shove all in. It folds around to the same dude as last time who calls me. I am sure I am about to get my revenge.. This dude turns over pocket 4's. He had 4 of a god damn kind.

I don't claim to be a professional, and am still pretty new, but man. It was a massive ego hit after I played a pretty damn good game in my mind and felt I should have won both hands. Sometimes it's just your night, or I got outplayed. Not sure which.

I should also mention this was a home game so I didn't even get a bad beat jackpot :("

poker,A Live Pre-Flop Hand that I was proud of,"Went to the casino Sunday to play a 1/2 cash game. Bought in for $100 had a couple big ups and downs but I think it was about 2 hours in and my stack was around 140. The SB, my opponent this hand, was down to 38 and had been getting a little tilted and loose.

So I was BB and draw KhQh and 3 people limp to the SB, who shoves.

In that moment, I made 3 judgments:

1. My opponent was most likely to have a lower pair.
2. If I call confidently the other players are likely to fold.
3. KhQh is just slightly under 50/50 vs low pair (Calculated it afterwards and i was correct- actually an interesting point KQs is actually better than AKs vs low pair!)

So based on these judgments, I'd be getting getting 36 : 46 payout for calling just under 50 : 50 odds. Thanks for reading

poker,"From a strategy standpoint, is it better to call down with AJ or JTs in a 3-bet pot?","Hypothetical scenario:

9-max 100bb effective

You open AJ or JTs from HJ to 3bb

Button 3bets to 9bb

Folds to you, and you call.

Flop is 23Jr

You check, button bets 8bb. You call.

Turn: 5s, bringing a flush draw. You don't have a spade in either of your hypothetical hands. You check, he bets 22bb.

River is a benign 9 of hearts. You check, villain bets 61bb and is all in.

So obviously this a tough spot. Villain is leveraging his range advantage on this board (all the over-pairs).

On the flop we were getting 3.25 : 1 on a call (so we will continue with any jack, maybe some underpairs like TT,99 or two over cards, suited cards with backdoors.

On the turn we were getting 2.55 : 1 on call (by calling, we are really capping our range here as just bluff catcher. Strong hands and bluffs are most likely raising by now)

On the river we were getting 1.28 : 1 on a call

So from a blocker standpoint, we definitely don't want an ace in our hand because we want him to have the bricked gut-shot. We definitely don't want the Ace of spades in our hand, because that blocks a bunch of spade draw / gut-shot combo draws he picked up on the turn. So maybe JTs no spades would make a better call in this scenario?

However, if we have JT then we are vulnerable when villain 3bet AJ or KJs preflop. Granted KJs is villain going for thin value, but I definitely think it is possible.

So is AJ or JTs a more +EV river call here?"

poker,are my HUD stats wrong? or is this actually real lmao,"so drivehud works with z now on BOL and that is where i play. i have noticed that the HUD would still get peoples stats when it wasn't able to work on zoom, you just couldn't have the HUD up while playing... but i am looking at these stats and they are absolutely bonkers... is this fucking real?? look at how tight this is and this is pretty much the same for every player in the pool... even my stats are super tight but i am working on that and recently have been playing a lot looser.

&amp;#x200B;

could it be that when i fold a hand fast before any action happens pre flop that the HUD just doesn't realize when a person is opening or calling??? 

here they are. be prepared to cringe

poker,Do other poker sites take 30%+ rake like Bovada? What are the lowest rake real money poker apps/sites?,"# Has anyone noticed the money from Re-Entries are not being added to the prize pool?

I noticed recently a new feature on Bovada Poker where you can ""Re Enter"" from 0-10 times depending on the tournament. This is different from a ""Re-Buy"".

See attached screenshots showing the Total Prize Pool only including the money from the Buy Ins. And they Delete the list of how many re entries occurred.

Breakdown of the numbers:

\- 273 Re entries X $25 = $6,825. (Your Greed = 24.2% of ending prize pool that should be added to the prize pool. Totalling over 34% Rake. I'm sure people would like to know the breakdown and a list of your competitors that rake less than 15%)

\- 1130 entrants X $2.50 = $2,825 (Standard 10% Rake of the Buy In Fee) 

\- 273 re entries X $2.50 = $682.50 (standard 10% rake of the re entry fee)

\- Total Bovada Rake for a $28,300 Prize Pool = $10,332.50

poker,When is the most reasonable time to use implied odds?,"I was wondering about this question. Below is my understanding of implied odds so far. If there's anything wrong then point it out please.

IMPLIED ODDS: 

How much money the opponent has left and how much you think they will put in with a bet

-good implied odds are where the opponent can't tell if you have a good hand. 

Ex: 56. Flop: k78

-bad odds are where it's easy to tell

Ex: A9. Flop: 10JQ

-first find pot odds

-then find odds of completing your winning hand

Ex: the opponent bets 15 into a pot of 20 making it 35. You need 15 to call. We have 2♡ in our hand and there are 4♡ on the board with only the river left.

-1.) 35:15 = 2:1 = 33% equity needed for a profitable call

-2.) Equity is 20% because 9 outs × 2 = 18 (rounded up)
In this instance we would fold 

Now for implied odds:

-equation:

--Amnt to call ÷ opp bet + pot size + amnt to call + how much to win river = equity

-- 15 ÷ 15 + 20 + 15 + x = .2 (20%)

-- 15 ÷ 50 + x = .2

-- .2 × 50 + .2 * x = 15

-- 10 + .2 * x = 15

-- .2 * x = 5 

-- x = 25

This means you will need to bet 25 dollars on the river to be profitable LONG TERM

Is this all I should bet for?

poker,1/2 NLHE: Roast my line.,"Game is 6 handed.  Villain sitting UTG ($200) is a thinking TAG.  LAG Hero ($140) has been running into it all night long.  Hero has fired off two bullets, is on final buyin before stop-loss (hence no top up), and might be showing some signs of tilt.  

Villain raises to $10 from UTG and Hero looks down at 76ss.  Hero makes the call and BB makes the call.  3 players to the flop.

Flop ($31) - 876r.  Action checks to hero who bets $12.  BB folds and Villain check/jams $130 effective.

Hero?

&gt;!I went deep into the tank.  This line makes no sense to me.  He can't reasonably assume I'm as strong as I am right?  If he was nutted, why would he overbet the pot like this when there are so many good hands in my range that I have to fold against this kind of bet?  Could he be doing this for protection with AA/KK?  Could he be open ended with something like 98s/99?  If I'm putting those hands in his range then how can I discount something like T9s (the nuts)? !&lt;

&gt;!Ultimately, I leveled myself into making the call.  My logic?  He's not going to spaz out and raise 2X the pot with the nuts when there are so many hands he could otherwise milk for value.  I got shown T9dd and bricked out.!&lt;

And then some dude with a huge stack, a total nut buster bro, he sucks out on me a couple rounds later. It sucks man. To go so deep with the nuts only to get busted by a suck out!

If you dont have a solution or an idea please dont post telling me to stop playing there.. that is the obvious result if i cant fix this.

Issue # 1: The problem im having is with my hud/hand histories. Im using drivehud and initially the results were different  daily from what DH said and ACR said. I contacted drivehud thinking it was an issue with them and they had me update and rebuild my database. This almost corrected the issue. My hud results were now .15c off and not ~1.50 off(testing out acr on 2nl so these are quite significant relative sizes). The drivehud rep told me i should compare my acr hand histories to try and find out what its missing. 

Welp. I go to acr and check my hand histories.. you guessed it. There is none in the viewer. Open the folder they are saved to.. none in there. Yes i have save hand histories set to the max days. I contact ACR and they have me send screenshots showing the hand histories arent there 72 hours later. They say theyll get back to me. 

I decide to play more hands. I played 436 hands in 2 sessions today. The hand histories were being tracked in acr and i saw the file there after the first session. In drivehud filtering for todays results it all matched except .01 cent for the day so far(115 hand session).  I played another session totaling 436 hands according to DH. Checked acr yup 436 hands there.. drivehud 436 hands cool... wait.. now the $$ in drivehud is off by around $2.3... I go to rebuild the DH database to see if it fixes it. Nope. I check ACR hand histories and poof.  They are all gone again... wtf is going on..

Tldr; acr hand histories are not saving and appearing to also causing weird hud tracking issues? Has this been a thing??

Issue #2 : i have auto topoff setup in cash games. When i go to check results for the day it will not list your topoff amounts.. i.e. Acr results screen wil read

 buy in : $2 cashout : $2.25 profit : -.50 

instead of showing $2.75 for the buy in.. is this an ACR thing or is this some kind of bug also?

Thanks if anyone can help.. still waiting acr response but i know thats likely not going to help. I know acr is lame but ive been enjoying it because it plays faster than bovada allowing more hands per hour without increasing tables.

Edit : A drivehud rep just got back to me and told me they move hand histories to another folder. So this issue might be hud related. I am going to send them everything later so they can try to find out why results are off. 

I still dont understand the topoff not being shown in the results screen on acr.."

Hand 1: stacks are ~100bb
Hero: BU AKo 2 limpers, raise to 20, 3 callers
Flop:AA9 rainbow, checks to me I bet 30, utg calls
Turn: 3s, now 2 spades on board, utg leads 40, call
River: Js, utg bets 75 I call. 

Hand 2: stacks are ~100bb
Hero CO with JTd, utg raises to 15, 2 callers, I call in position.
Flop: q63 all diamonds. Checks to me I bet 20, utg whale calls
Turn: offsuit queen. Utg leads for 40, I call.
River: 4d, utg 75, I call

Regarding opening ranges, it seems that there is almost no fold equity unless you are open raising like 15bb. Plenty of times there would be 4 limpers and then someone would raise to 10bb and they all call. With this in mind should I be opening hands like QJs and KQo behind lots of limpers? Often times I’ll hit top pair but top pair weak kicker is not amazing 5 ways."

poker,BB Float Strategy (Discussion),"After looking through my databases recently, I have noticed a pretty big leak stemming from my BB floats. This has become one of my biggest ""problems"" so to speak, as I feel like I am guessing a lot when it comes to my floats out of the BB. With mostly it turning into ""well I've got back door this or that, with A/K high, I guess I call."" 


The problem however is my sites population tendencies have turned to much bigger C-bets from MP/CO/BU with a c-bet percentage around 85-90%, which seems to light money on fire with a normally profitable flop C/R strategy. I don't have the number in front of me, but C/R defense is crazy high. So my floats feel like they are losing and my C/R seem too aggressive.


To remedy this, I noticed that I started playing probably way too tight out of the BB with a VPIP of 26.5%. I have seen a lot of people suggest a tighter flatting range in general from the BB because of this and playing a higher 3bet frequency, but I haven't seen a lot of discussion around float strategies. I don't know if I have the balls to 3bet the majority of my BB range lol.


Any other pros (lol or regs) have any thoughts about this in general? I'm not a part of any training sites atm, but I don't remember a lot of resources around this topic.


Thanks!"
poker,Bankroll management and increasing stakes,"Hey guys, I haven't been playing poker for too long. Played with fake money for a while, studied preflop ranges and strategies for a bit before I put real money in. Once I was confident enough in my own game and decided to play for some real money (not real big money, just not Zynga bucks lol) I deposited $20 to pokerstars last week. Worked it up to $90 so far. Won $58 from free roll tourney (placed 5th, went all in with TT against the big stacks 55, he caught a 5 on the turn) so besides the tourney i really havent built up my roll from cash games. 

My question is when do I move up in stakes? Playing $2 buy ins, I only walked away losing a small amount one session, the rest I was up. At what point do I consider going to $5 buy ins? Do you guys follow the rule of ""you must have 20 buyins in your roll to play at those stakes""? Should I continue with 1c/2c for a few more weeks or should I go up to 2c/5c when I hit $100? Just need some advice. I know it's a marathon, not a sprint, so I would like to act responsibly and set myself up for success if and when I do raise the stakes to say $1/$2 and so on."

Most of the table (and the room) is around 30-60k, I'm the largest stack at the table, with 2 others at the table &gt;100k.  This is near the end of day 1. 

MP Raises to 1.2k, he's been raising a lot of hands, his stack size is about 40-50k. 

BTN Reraises to 4.5k, he's a tight player, his stack size is about 120k.  He also felt like a good player, and likely to 3B light. 

SB Calls, he has around 40-50k - very loose player, likes to see flops, has shown a few very questionable bluffs

Hero wakes up in BB with AKcc, I raise to 12k. My stack size is ~150k.  While I've been playing tight, I've also been running a little hot and so I've been playing a lot of hands, and haven't gotten to showdown for most of them.  I probably look loose. 

MP folds.

BTN reraises again to 27k.  

SB folds. 

Hero?

&gt;!Because we're so deep, and I don't think the villain takes this line with anything besides AA, KK, and AK, I elect to call, but I think that was a mistake.  I think I should have just folded right there since I'm either chopping, or behind.!&lt;

&gt;!Flop comes something like [7s](/7s)[2s](/2s)[9h](/9h).  I check and villain bets very small, I think 11k. I was planning on folding flop if I missed, but for that price I feel like I have to call.  !&lt;

&gt;!Turn is [4s](/4s) and I decide I should lead on this card and bluff at the flush.  I bet around 30k, and villain thinks for a bit before calling.!&lt;

&gt;!River is [7d](/7d) which pairs the board but shouldn't really matter.  I decide to jam on this card, villian tanks for a while but eventually calls!&lt;

&gt;!Villain shows KK, obviously!&lt;

poker,"""Trick or Treat Takedown"" - Strangest promotion format I've ever heard of. Let's discuss it.","OK So here's the format of the promotion. 

Two tables of 10 players each are selected. Each get 3000 in chips. 

Each hand everyone posts 100 ante, sb is 100 and bb is 100.

The tables will play hand-for-hand for 15 hands. The winner of each hand wins the T$chips in the pot, plus an amount of REAL dollars, as follows:

Hand 1: $25  
2: $50  
3: $75  
4: $100  
5: $150  
6: $200  
7: $250  
8: $300  
9: $350  
10: $400  
11: $500  
12: $600  
13: $750  
14: $1000  
15: $1500

In other words, each hand's pot is splashed with the above $ amount. 

No table balancing will occur unless the field reduces to 10 or less. If this occurs all players will combine to one table and amount splashed will double. 

I already know that the EV of getting seated is $625

poker,How often are you playing hands?,"I decided to look up a free pre-flop chart and stick very closely to it. I played a 10NL full ring game online and didn't play a single hand in quite a few rotations. I simply blinded out .75 cents and ending the session without playing a hand at all. I'm wondering if this is typical for TAG players.

Has TAG image and not played a lot of hands but recently double barreled, got called down, and x/f river to villain, fwiw. Villain is a splashy fun player with table talk. Sometimes will say ""I think you're going to win this one/lose this one, my friend"" while betting.

Villain is UTG and straddles for $6. Folds to button who makes it $25. Hero in SB has 9d9c, considers 3! for some seconds but eventually calls. Villain calls. Should I be 3-betting here?

**Flop:**  
Pot: $75  
Cards: 8s7h8d

Hero donks $50. I think this flop his my range more than villain and button. I pretty much never donk, but is this a reasonable spot to do so for protection? Villain thinks and calls, button folds.

**Turn:**  
Pot: $175  
Card: 6d

Hero checks. In retrospect, I think this is probably a bad check since there can still be lots of scary rivers, but mostly just wanted to pot control. I am open ended so I don't hate the idea of seeing a card, too. But candidly, I'm not sure what range to put villain on. I'm heavily blocking straights and kinda blocking flush draws, which I suppose makes an 8 more likely. I'm hoping he has 76s, A7s, maybe one of the remaining 97s. I essentially decide I will check/call here, with the potential of trying to bluff catch the river depending on runout.

**River:**  
Card: Jd

Hero checks per the plan. Villain says, ""I think I'm going to win this one, my friend"" and slides out a stack of red. We call.

Writing this now, I realize I'm probably an idiot for considering my straight blockers here on the river, since he checked the turn back. Is the 9d still relevant enough to be a flush blocker? Are you making this call?

Villain shows Js7s for rivered two pair. Maybe I'm just being results oriented, but I don't think I played this well, and not just cause he hit a 5-outer on the river. I think I was like, halfway to thinking about this properly but not incorporating the other half lost me this pot."

poker,How you guys overcome fatigue in a tournament.,"In the past month I have been playing 2 day tournaments. I got second in a deep stack, and I played hard, and got second, when I was in heads up, I was already exhausted since I actually played a turbo day 1 on the same day so I already played 5 hours more than anyone else on the final table so i have been playing poker for 13 hours. And My mentality just isn't holding anywhere near to keep my normal skill level, and I tell myself to focus and keep drinking water and eat health but you know everyone has that limit.  So I end up jamming 58 suited pref flop and you know I get called and lose.

Yesterday, I played another big event, 302 entries+205 retries. I played hard and got to the final 9, first hand I was dealt 39suited on the button I just randomly said allin. and I got called by KJ on the sb and I was out, I didn't do any of that punting anytime before the final, I just min raise or 2.3\~2.5x raised if I wanted to make a move but I don't know why I punt off my hard work.

Again just like poker preflop I guess preparation is very helpful, to sleep well and to think about your goals, and drink watwe you can, and prepare knowing that you will get exhausted and you just have to keep moving on,  It has only has been a few times I have tried these tournament and my goal is to play for those very big tournament the next year so I'm really trying to mimic what good players do, I'm taking lessons from every session and reviewing to improve myself, so again I think this is another one for me."

poker,How to play short stack at tournament,"Qualified from a satelite to main event in my first live tournament.

&amp;#x200B;

Normal stack depth is 20k, but for those who qualified through satelite, we bring the stack we finished the satelite with.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at 10k tournament starts with 100/200 blinds, BB also pays a 200 ante.

Do I want to try to get an average stack in the beginning and be a bit more aggressive, or just continue with my normal game and let thing take their course?

poker,3 bet squeezing hands at live low stakes,"At tables where the play is generally passive and I'm able to recognize players with opening ranges that are not just uber premiums my 3 bet bluffing range is pretty wide. 

My favorite 3 bet hands are suited Kings such as K7s K8s because they're not good enough to call with but don't do so bad heads up. Obvs have suited aces there, those are no brainers don't want to talk about those. 

I see a lot of tag players add a lot of suited connectors of the 76 78 type in their 3 bet bluffing range and I prefer a hand like Q7 that can't make a straight but in tough spots can make an okay top pair and can be an okay 3 bet out of position. Which do you think is a better 3 bet bluffing hand out of the two?"
poker,2019 Boyaa Poker Tournament Europe Schedule Announced,
poker,1/2 deep,"Posted a tough beat from Friday but got some encouragement to regroup for Saturday when this hand happened. Hero has loose table image after being hit with the deck for the past two hours. 

H (480) opens KJss to 20 over 5 straddle in UTG+2 

V (covers) flats SB 

Flop Q23xxc

Check, I bet 20, V calls

Turn 10c

Check, I bet 55, V raises to 155, hero flats

River 9c

Check, H jams, V tanks for a long time and calls


Thoughts on line? V was pretty TAG. Could I ever shove turn? Would be repping exactly QQ or maybe TT. But his A high clubs might fold, MAYBE even 22 or 33? 

My thoughts were that he’s committing too much of his stack and if I hit my open ender the money is going in 100%. Therefore when he is raising to 155, I essentially need to call 100 to potentially win 950 or so."

poker,8-Game tips for a beginner (micros),"Hi all, I’ve recently discovered a love for 8-Game after watching some YouTube and playing a little myself. I’m a MTT micros grinder, mostly playing NLHE and some PLO tourneys. 

I managed to cash my first 8-Game tourney with 2 entries and have gathered my strongest games are naturally NLHE, PLO and surprisingly 2-7 triple draw (mostly because micros players seem to overvalue weak hands). But I know I struggle with Limit HE, Stud 8 and Razz. 

From players who are good at mixed games, what is your best advice for each of the games, in particular Stud and Limit HE? Thanks in advance"
poker,Mathematically - would limping be okay in my case?,"I'm basing this question off of solely equity: (%Win x amount you stand to win) - (%Loss x amount to call)

I play in a low skilled home game with other high schoolers. Let's say I'm UTG. If I limp, there's an over 50% chance so does everybody else. I typically raise a standard 3BB. 

Let's use 33 as an example. I'm going to assume I only win this hand if I hit a set, and I lose otherwise. There's a 3(1/25) chance of this on the flop, so 12%. If I miss it there, there's about an 8% I hit it on the turn or river. Overall, about a 20% chance I win this hand. Obviously I'm oversimplifying for theoretical purposes. So if I limp, and so does everybody else, my equity is: (.20 x 6BB) - (.80 x 1BB) = 1.2BB. Positive equity.

But traditional strategy would probably be to fold here, and if not, raise. But if I raise, I quadruple my amount to call, and therefore to make the same equity as limping I would need four callers, which I'm usually not going to get. Unfortunately I have no solvers or other programs to help me do this math, so I've relied on oversimplification to figure it out. For example, I know if two people fold that increases my chances of winning. But is it significant enough to make this positive equity? I'm a very new player so if any of this looks off please offer input. I'm trying to figure out why folding/raising is usually a good play, because for me it's just been making me see less hands and then losing more money when I do see hands."
poker,Things that tilt me about live poker volume 3,"1) When someone new sits down with a stack of £5s then regularly asks the dealer to give them singles, even when they aren't in a hand, or in the blinds, or about to tip a waitress, or have any need for singles. 

2) Dealers who give them change instead of telling them to wait. 

3) A live loyalty promotion freeroll for regular players, where qualification is based on how many days you played that month. This means there is a legion of nits/ OMCs who play an hour or two every day, rake almost zero and then leave. If qualification was based on hours per month I could just play 3 or 4 days a week for 7 or 8 hours each. Instead I have to come in on the tube on Mondays to play when the games are dead because all the OAP nits are there. This also makes the games worse because of the OAPs being there every day.     

4) People who tank for 3 minutes on the river before raising with the nuts, as if tanking for 3 minutes is going to make me think you might be bluffing. I already knew I was bet/folding when I bet, you can just snap rip and I will snap fold and we can both save time.

5) People who do long, over the top staredowns at me in a £50 pot. What does this even accomplish?

6) The UK government has brought in ridiculous money laundering rules. This has led to certain recreational players getting banned because they can't prove the source of their funds. Some pros even get suspended if they can't prove where they get their money, even when everyone knows they are pros.

7) People who hide their stack under their hands and then pitch a fit when I do the 'hands up' motion so I can see what they are playing.

8) Guys who don't understand the rules and then argue with the dealer about it.

9) Anyone who complains about people giving action. If someone wants to play LAG, straddle, raise a lot, 3b, 4b, spew, make bluffs, show bluffs etc. this is GREAT and should always be encouraged. It doesn't matter if it is a whale or a pro. If you want to complain about someone, complain about OMC nits.

10) regulars who complain every time they are losing, or lose a decent sized pot. It is kind of shocking IMO that there are regs who sit with 200 every day, have done this since before I was playing poker, and are tilted and whining if they lose QQ vs AK in a £200 pot. Like dude, how are you not used to this by now?"
poker,Me in a 2 Rebuy + 1 Addon Tournament,
poker,Some advice for my fellow punters who want to become successful at this game. My story.,"Warning: Long 

Why do we punt? I’m sure just like myself, many of you have found yourselves in situations deep in a tournament, maybe just 15 players left, you’re the chip leader, the stage is set for an epic finish. All of a sudden you attempt a huge unnecessary bluff and your stack is decimated to half it’s original size. 

Panic settles in, frustration and emotion warp your decision making. You’re now adamant this won’t happen again and look for any spot to double up. As you fold 83 off suit utg, your chips further dwindle and you feel a sense of urgency. You manage to get your last 9 big blinds all in with K10 from the button and say a silent prayer. Villain has you drawing dead on the flop and you stare at the payout screen in shock, wondering what might’ve been. 

Across my long online tournament career, I’ve punted stacks in ways that could only be described as bordering on insanity. Literally 100s of times in key spots, many for 10s or even 100s of thousands of dollars in equity. I remember a few years ago it was really bad. I was almost broke (would’ve been the 5th time that happened while playing poker) and punted off a chip leading stack in a massive wcoop tournament nearing the final table in absolute classic fashion. 

This was for life changing money, heck even the cash in 11th place was a lifeline to me at the time. I was pretty devastated though and it was one of my lowest moments as a player. Not because of what happened, but because the same punting cycle just kept repeating itself. Ironically this was the last time I ever considered quitting poker as a profession. 

Why you may ask? Shouldn’t the despair of another failure and years of perceived wasted time make me finally want to quit? That was my first reaction yes. Instead of improving as a player or fixing my mindset leaks, my first instinct was to sacrifice thousands of hours of dedication to this game and to just give up poker. It was the easy option.

We all have decisions to make, some will change the way our lives pan out forever. I twisted up a fat joint, stared in my bathroom mirror and asked myself the key questions; does this make you happy? Will you fix your multiple leaks? How much are you willing to sacrifice to truly achieve the goals you’ve set for yourself in this game? How much do you want it?

Just like the merging of yin and yang or embracing the dark or the light, there’s a duality which guides every aspect of our being. A choice we are forced to make at very pertinent moments in our lives.

When you’re offered a choice between two very different paths, strongly consider how each one will have an overall impact on your journey. Will going left or right get you where you want to go and with what pitfalls along the way?   

Everyday we make choices, some trivial, some very important. However most people make those decisions without considering the divergent paths their lives will take once they’ve chosen.

Even simple decisions like having a healthy breakfast instead of a greasy one can lead to huge implications over time, mainly because we’re creatures of habit. That’s what punting off stacks had become to me, it was literally a freakin habit. 

If you wake up and eat fried eggs on toast with butter every morning for a few years, the thought of having a vegetable smoothie or even intermittent fasting would seem almost alien. However one thing we underestimate about ourselves is our ability to transform and retrain our habits far quicker than we’d ever imagine. 

The decision making aspect of your brain is like a muscle, train it and over time the difficult tasks become rather simple. The gym becomes appealing, eating a huge salad is something you look forward to and playing your A game becomes second nature, especially in the highest pressure moments when it’s most needed. 

You see, that’s what separates the sports stars or poker players who make it to the top and those who don’t. Can you perform when the pressure is on and when it matters the most? It’s all good shipping a minor tourney with ease but can you maintain your best game when on the last 3 tables of the Sunday million? When the money truly changes your life. Do you want more from this game than it just being a hobby you dabble in because becoming a pro is too tough? 

I had to face these questions many times across my career and they were challenging, filled with regret and abject hope. After recognising my leaks, working on mindset, gym etc, things began to improve. There was one imperative addition I made to my game though. I hired a coach and reviewed my hand histories. In half an hour this guy taught me more than a decade of playing had shown me. I had leaks everywhere and my ego had completely clouded my judgment about my game. I was a donk basically. He greatly helped in retraining my fundamentals and without a solid foundation in whatever we do in life, we’ll always feel like the floor can fall from beneath us at anytime. 

Years have passed since this period in my life and I’ve gone on to become a professional and had some decent success. I did this by letting go of the apprehension and focusing on my decision making during a tournament like a surgeon operating on his patient. Every move is calculated and meticulously carried out while constantly reducing the margin for error. 

This differed drastically to my previous decision making process which was so haphazard. It proved to me how possible it was to retrain my bad habits and failing career into one I felt excited about facing every single day. I still punt from time to time but not the way I used to. It still happens but just at a much reduced rate. I’ve learned to accept it when this happens and do my best to learn from it. Poker is really tough, especially if you want it to be your source of income. You’ll make a plethora of mistakes learning along the way but recognise your leaks before they become your habits. Address them and move forward with confidence. 

Many people give up without realising how close they were to success  before they threw in the towel. You have to really want it though and be willing to sacrifice temporary, short term pleasure in order to reach your targets. Maintain a high level of humility, diligence and focus and literally nothing can stop you, not just in poker but in life as a whole. 

So the next time you’re about to punt off a stack, take that extra 15 seconds to ponder it over, remember the icm implications, the significant time you’ve dedicated to getting this deep and the thousands of hours you’ve sacrificed to becoming competent at this game. 

Most importantly, whether you decide to punt it or not, have 100% confidence in your decision or as close to it as possible. If you don’t believe in the plays you’re making, no one else will either. It’s the same in life, if you lack that intrinsic belief in yourself, you can’t expect others to believe in you. 

You want to become a successful player? Put every fibre of your being into it and come and get it! 

Best of luck and thanks for reading."

poker,"Is playing a high rake home game worth it with enough aggressive, loose players?","I'm trying to think through if playing at a home game is worth it. It's a very loose $1/3 game with the standard raise from any position being $25-$50. Tons of rebuys, seems like people bring a few $k in cash. I bought in for $300 and cashed out for $1841 after 2.75 hrs. The game was 6 handed the whole time. The rake is 10% up to $22. Dealer was relatively fast since the table had a shuffler.

poker,A couple more poker etiquette questions...,"Hello - so a couple more etiquette questions came up at a home game I attend last night. I am a senior in high school, started playing weekly games with my friends a couple months ago, .1/.2 $20 buy in NL Hold'em. 

1) Three players limp in preflop - SB, BB and Button. Checks through flop + turn. SB and BB check river, and button reaches to bet. Worth noting this is button's first game and he is very new to poker. BB says: ""Dude, c'mon, don't bet. I'm folding if you bet."" I laugh and say: ""He's button he literally has nothing to lose by betting if he's got the best hand, even if you fold."" Button then bets and BB gets mad at me for saying that, arguing he could have made him fold. I said sorry but also told him to relax, it wasn't that big of a deal given we're playing a home game with friends and we're not at a casino. However, I realize maybe I was out of line because I wasn't in the hand and want input. 

2) I wasn't involved in this hand, but it was an interesting moment. This time five players see the flop. UTG, UTG + 1, MP, CO, and Button. Checks flop - everybody just sort of tapping the table and saying check, it happens very quickly. Then it checks turn in the same way, dealer says ""everybody checks?"" to make sure everyone agrees and then shows river. Now, UTG is holding his cards, everybody else has their cards on the table. The issue here is UTG +1 says check, MP says check, and CO bets. However, UTG doesn't say anything so people assume he tapped or said check quietly. UTG +1 and MP snap fold. CO calls, then Button and CO debate who is gonna show first for a few seconds and then count down and show at the same time. Button wins with top pair. Then UTG throws his cards down and says, ""Hey, I won!"" showing two pair. CO and Button both look at him and say they didn't think he was in. They ask him where his bet was and he says he was skipped and then puts his bet in the pot. A debate breaks out - some say because he was skipped he can still call, and that's the fault of CO and Button. Some say it was very unclear he was in the hand and he should've said something. What happens here?

poker,AITA for raging at a tournament asshole?,"I played a tournament last night, which I rarely do. Live at local card room. $65 buyin, that is, $50+$15 in fee. The good thing about this tourney is that you could rebuy for $50 if you were eliminated, meaning you could rebuy without rake. 

You could rebuy at any time during the first hour, then no more rebuys.

So you can see what happened already. What happened is that after 50 mins, I could into a huge coinflip, my AK vs his 99. He flopped a 9 and I was drawing dead. No big deal, this stuff happens.

After the count, I was left with less than a big blind. Like 25 chips or something silly like that, I barely covered the guy with 99. You can see the problem already.

I went all-in with 53o and two people called. I was happy about that, because it meant I would get eliminated quickly, and could rebuy for the full stack. 

Bad luck, I flopped 2 pairs, and ended up with like 1.5BB. I shoved next hand, one guy called, and I got 2BB (like 200 chips, most people had 3-4k and more). I shoved like JTo the next and it fold to Mr. Asshole, who paused, and then realized what was going on.

He folded 88 face up, which should have been a trivial call. He then told the table ""hey guys, stop calling his shoves. Only a few minutes left and he can't rebuy anymore and he has to play with that stack.""

I didn't get what he meant, but soon it became painfully obvious. I got T4 the next hand, shoved, and everyone folded. The rebuyin period ended in like 5 minutes.

At this point, Mr. Asshole starting taking a LONG time to take his decisions. Like a minute to fold his hand pre.

  I told him ""If I rebuy, the prize pool will be bigger."" He replied: ""I don't care, I just want you out.""

I shoved again, and sure enough, everyone folded. At this point, I asked the dealer if I could do a short stack rebuy. He said the tournament didn't allow it. I had to go broke to be allowed to rebuy.

Asshole then started to count down the time and sure enough, people played slowly/folded to my shove, and I couldn't rebuy in time. I heard the guy on the speakers ""we are taking a short break please be aware the rebuy is over blah blah blah."" I was stuck with like 300 chips, which was like 3BB. If I had lost my stack and been allowed to rebuy, at an attractive price (no rake), I would have had like 50BB or something like that

 I told him it was an ""asshole move"" and he said ""asshole win tournaments."" I told him he better win, because I would wait at the barfor him to get eliminated and then go laugh at him. He grinned.

Is this normal stuff from tourney? This was my first real tournament live and I've played online, and never quite saw anything like that (meaning the way he played)."

poker,"I'll just admit it, I can't win at online poker.","Not consistently anyway, and when I do, it just isn't worth the time invested. A usual cash-game session for me will result in me either winning about 9BB/100 hands, OR getting felted by someone hitting a draw when I was the favored to win.  The wins just don't cover the losses + the rake. When I look at it all combined, I am losing 2BB/100 hands online. It's a slow march towards a deflated bankroll!

So then I start questioning my style and think, maybe I'm playing too tight and perhaps I should loosen up and go for a few more marginal hands. Maybe bluff a little more?? Sometimes that works out, sometimes it doesn't.

I have slightly better results playing live for much bigger stakes, which is crazy really. However it requires me to drive an hour to the casino, play a very slow paced session for a few hours and then driving back. So I might spend 6 hours total trip and win like 5BB per hour played (4 hours playing, 2 hours driving) = around  $50 to $85 profit for the day and every once in a while a big win of a few hundred when the deck hits me hard and I win a cooler or catch a bluff at the right time.

I'm starting to feel as if I would get better results just playing blackjack for a few hours!

In response I was told that he was okay to do what he did because he had mentally folded and he wouldn’t have done it if he was going to call.

Do you think that the dealer is out of line here?"
poker,Florida online player using Ignition reporting taxes,"How do you guys do it? If someone wants to take out over $10k can they deposit it, report it and not face repercussions for reporting online poker income in Florida. Not quite sure if online poker can be taxed as legal income. Will reach out to a tax professional but figured ask here first."
poker,Does this break etiquette?,"There was a set of 3 9’s on the flop, and I had a 9 in my hand. I knew I’d win the hand so I raised slow, and said “damn whoever has a 9 takes it all” Implying I didn’t have a 9. 

Obviously, I won over someone with 3 Aces and took about 20% of the total pot."

poker,First poker session cooler,"1/2 NL Hold em in Michigan. Hero’s stack is 120.
Villain 1 UTG, and 2 others limp. Hero on Button AsAd, raise to $15, Villan 2 in SB calls UTG call all others fold. Pot: 50 stack 105.

FLOP: 9s8c3h checks to me bets 25 both call Stack: 80 pot: 125

TURN: 10s both Villans check. Raises 50 (hindsight should’ve gone all in.) Villan 2 in SB raises all in. UTG reraises all in.

Is there any way avoiding this spot. I’ll post what villains have after my drive of shame home 😂."

poker,Line Check: smart shove with KK in position?,"First, wanna thank you all for all the advice and analysis over the past few weeks I’ve been posting here. Y’all are helping me think clearer and smarter and I really appreciate. OTTH: 

Blinds 500/1000. Villain effective stack 52k on BB. Folds to me on CO with KK, I raise up to 3k. Folds to villain who flats. We see a flop: QT3r. Villain checks, I bet 4k, villain calls. Turn is a 6h (2 hearts now). Villain bets 4k, I jam my remaining 28k. Villain calls, he had JT and the river is a dud for him so we scoop a healthy pot. I thought I played it well but looking back, I guess he could’ve had a set of 3s or 6s or weird 2 pairs that call my pfr but I was thinking at best he had a pair of queens or a flush draw. Was this a +EV shove or should I elect to just raise his turn bet next time?"
poker,Buy In Amount.,I have a local game that plays 1/2 NLHE. The pre flop raises are usually 15 or more. The minimum buy in is 100$ and the max buy in is 500$. The players are usually gamblers who goest all in when they hit top pair even with a weak kicker. How much should i buy in when the players usually buy in at 200$-300$ pre-game.

poker,being a good poker citizen as an entertainment player,"My online site offers straddle, no-look all-in, do it multiple times all-in, and all-in draw card insurance.  So far I'm realizing that this form of play, which is really just spending money rather than trying to be profitable, makes me a lot happier as long as I manage the cost.  That won't be as much as profit-oriented play but it's enough.

The problem is that I could be disrupting tables and making messes playing that way.  Any thoughts on how I can be a good citizen while enjoying the game the way I want to enjoy it?"

poker,2/5 Line Check,"I was playing a 9 handed 2/5 NL HE session at Borgata recently.  Had a hand I was hoping to get some opinions on to see if you think I was able to extract maximum value or if I could’ve played it differently:

I had a 30’s white hoody guy TAG show a big hero fold in the following hand.

*I had K10o in the BB and called his 25 raise from the HJ. The raise was also called by an EP Villian as well who had limped in.  

*Flop came 10/10/Q rainbow.  I checked and he bet 50, I called after short tank. 

*Turn was 8c and I bet 75. He read me after a pretty short tank and made the hero fold showing KQ.  I did show him the 10 after that.  

How could I have extracted more value on this hand? Pretty sure I didn’t have any tells and we didn’t have a lot of hands together.  Maybe he is more NIT than I thought.  10 is certainly in my B.B. calling range so that may have tipped him off but I honestly thought he would reraise my 75.  Any insight is appreciated."
