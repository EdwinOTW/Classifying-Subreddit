blackjack,New Look Feedback &amp; State of the Subreddit,"Hi everybody!

I'm BegginMcGreggin, one of the absentee mods of this community.

This subreddit has grown tremendously since I first joined. At the time, we were lucky to get a post a week, and now we have pretty consistent daily activity.

With that growth in mind, I've decided to give us a new look. I wasn't a fan on the default look nor the one we left behind when the new Reddit UI came into effect.

I have added a few links on the sidebar and hope to add rules down the line.

I'd appreciate any thoughts on the new look as well as the state of the sub in general. Go easy on me guys, literally slapped this all together in less than hour!"

blackjack,"""Reinstating"" Players card after being kicked out. Has anyone done this?","A couple months ago I was kicked out of my favorite casino in Vegas. It is my regular place to be and I had been going there for about 4 years. After a long night on a weekday, pushing my luck, and staying too late they finally asked me to stop playing. I know everyone on the floor so they were nice about it.

Recently I asked about coming back and the manager informed me that after 6 months of the date of the incedent I can ask to be ""reinstated"" which would include a meeting with the head gaming manager. I'm going to ask when the time comes but has anyone done this before?"

blackjack,Are card counting slumps a thing?,"I thought I had gotten pretty good at counting, started consistently winning in casinos and in the app on my phone I practice with. I had won every time I went to the casino for about  month, but these last two weekends I'm in the hole and I'm getting pretty discouraged. With a high running and true count with my larger bets out on the table, I'm almost always losing them. Just seems like bad luck to me. Could be wrong, but it seems that a high count is less advantageous when there is a full table. Any insight?"

blackjack,Why does no one mention casinos not letting players enter a round mid game?,"There are casinos with good rules dealing hand held games that won't let you enter a round until the dealer starts a new deck. I'm not talking about 6 deck, I'm talking about DD and SD with good rules. People talk about back counting and Wonging but these conditions don't allow opportunity for it.  You can't reenter a game either. Once you're out you're out.  It is like this at Paris LV, Gold strike MS, Horseshoe MS, and possibly Beau Rivage."

blackjack,EV of flat betting while using card counting indices alongside basic strategy.,Is it possible to gain an edge over the house without altering bet size and only using basic strategy deviances based on TC? And how would it compare to a strategy of only varying bets while using standard basic strategy as well as varying bets while also using indices? I think knowing this could be pretty beneficial towards games with low bet spreads.

blackjack,Educational Investment,"I’m debating what would be the best investment to learning as I get into counting. I already own a decent starting library of 3-5 books that have been useful.

I’m debating if I need to invest in more online tools to get better. BJA has bet spread software and training tools but costs a few hundred bucks. I was looking at dishing out $100 for CVCX, which I know will at least help me map out a decent bet spread. I’ve looked up other free materials but haven’t found much so far. What would be the best option in your opinion for how to train? I don’t have a huge bankroll since I’m just starting out and not much live experience, debating if I should be dishing out a few hundred bucks for some of this stuff, or save it for my bankroll."

blackjack,Counting Question: If the High/Low cards are equal.. why does the count stay negative much more than positive?,"This has been bothering me for a while.  I know the # of high cards (10s and Aces) is equal to the number of low cards (2-6) in every deck, so why wouldn't the count tend to be positive as often as it is negative?  It seems to me that the count is negative about 75% of the time and it is only about 1/4 of the time I can raise my bet as the count gets positive.  Seems like that shouldn't be the case but it certainly feels that way.  Am I alone in feeling like that and what is the mathematical reason for it?  It feels like the deck is stacked against us sometimes."

I've heard of CVCX, but I'm being kind of cheap right now until I have my first few experiences actually counting in live play. What's like an example of a normal spread for a newbie?

blackjack,Dealer’s choice blackjack,"I’m playing heads up with a dealer and he’s winning most every hand. It’s a shoe game so the dealer deals my first card face up then deals himself a face down hole card. He’s dealing quickly as some dealers like to do playing heads up.  So as time saving device, he slides the next two cards out of the shoe, turns them over with one hand and deals me another card with the other hand before placing the remaining card face up on top of his hole card. 

Most every one of my face cards received a bust card to go with it and vice versa. I should always be receiving the bottom card of the two taken out of the shoe but it was hard to tell. Maybe I received the top card sometimes. 

Or maybe it was late and I imagined this was his way of dealing. I didn’t bother to stay for the whole shoe and called it a night."
blackjack,What are your guys opinion on playing rated?,The most recent post got me thinking. What are your guys’ on opinion on playing rated? My opinion is that I don’t want the casino tracking my play mainly because I want to avoid getting backed off. But I can’t really put a monetary value of being backed off. Therefore I can’t establish a monetary trade off between being comped vs not comped. I’m looking to go to Vegas this winter. I know most of the casinos are either owned by mgm/caesars. I’m expecting to not play rated. Is this the right mindset to have?

I'm planning 1 trip for October for my 1st tournament and possibly another trip in November. My bf and I make yearly trips to las vegas and I'm always looking for good opportunities for discounts and comp rooms. I have a separate budget for my bankroll and it's not like I'm taking out loans to play. The goal is to play, win and get out. If I spend my bankroll, then too bad I don't get to play for a while. Before this, I had a shopping problem.

Do I have a gambling addiction? Is playing black jack as a way to make money so wrong?"
blackjack,"Wanting to learn AP/Card Counting, any tips?","**TL;DR** Please suggest me books, forums, software other than CVCX/CVBJ (which I will likely get in a few days), bankroll advice for $25 betting unit H17 DAS RSA game, thanks. New to card counting/AP but am willing to put in time to practice and learn. 

I'm thinking of getting CVCX, CVBJ, using Hi/Lo for counting, saving $10,000-$20,000 from my job to use as a bankroll and work on sims/read books. Thoughts/suggestions? I did some research over the past few days, but I want to make sure that I haven't missed anything before I start on a ~$200 initial investment. I recognize that this will take a lot of time to actually get to a competent level enough to step foot in a casino.

If you could suggest me any good forums/software/books to do more research/reading/practice on this, that'd be really nice. The casinos around me from my experience have a 6 deck H17 DAS RSA game (being $25-$500), and this would be considered the ""best"" game available around my area. There is a S17 DAS RSA game as well, however the limits for that game are $50-$1000. Hence the large starting bankroll...Will not step foot into a casino until I'd be competent enough/happy with my results in CVBJ. But yeah a $25-$200 or $25-$300 bet spread is going to require that kind of bankroll I imagine...

Side note: I started dealing blackjack at one of the three Detroit casinos (after completing academy), and I was frankly kind of shocked on how many players didn't know basic strategy or close to it (hint: everyone), a common instance I found myself dealing was soft 18 vs. dealer 4, 5, 6 and finding the player **stand** on that hand. Another example of many I would see would be watching 99 not split vs. dealer 8 or 9. Not to mention the occasional hard 16 tank against a dealer 7/8/9/T....point is, I'm fascinated by I've come across nobody who knew basic strategy at least to that point, also everyone is always flat betting but that is to be expected. I come from a background of grinding $1/$2 and $2/$5 NLHE, so I'm not completely new to playing games I have an advantage in and have this kind of mindset already."
blackjack,T/F Counting as only one at table is harder than a full table?,"Curious to get some feedback on this one. I'm not an expert counter by any means but in my personal experience I feel as if, well I guess, more comfortable with a full table counting because I have more time to process everything.

Yesterday, I was at Rampart in Vegas at 10am and was the only one on a table for an hour and literally ran through 2.5 shoes before I hit my limit for the day. Ended up losing $132 total which is totally my fault for playing in those conditions (only one on the table &amp; not being able to keep count) with house edge only 0.47%. Was only down $10-$15 after the first shoe, and second shoe was where I totally took a dump. 

I started counting on the first shoe, but as the speed of the game was literally determined by me I felt more pressure by the time I was dealt to count, make a decision, add that in, make another decision and then progress from there. Totally lost count by the 5th or 6th hand. After that, played BS through the rest of the shoe and tried again on the second. Same thing. 

So any opinions/ suggestions? Looking for straight up feedback, looking to get better in any way."
blackjack,My card counting tip for visual people: make pairs of hi+lo,"Not talking about same card pairs. I count way faster since I started doing this visual technique. I pair up low and high cards in my mind and ignore them, and only count the offset, which should only be either high or low, not mixed. I find it slow to go like 1-2-1-2-3-2 and leaves more marging of error instead of being like:ok those all nullify each other; 1, 2, 3  low cards, count was 7, now it's 10. I also count in 2 batches. The initial cards being dealt to players + dealer upcard. Add it to running count. Then I keep counting all the new cards of the round without adding it to the running card until the end of the round.

Ex:

Dealer:\[10\] \[X\]

P1:      **\[2\]\[10\]**           

P2: **\[6\]\[10\]**

\^ ignore players, only count -1 for dealer, instead of 1,0, 1, 0, -1. It's just as easy to match say a card from player 1 with player 2

Dealer: \[2\]\[x\]

P1:   \[7\]**\[2\]**      

P2: **\[10\]**\[8\]

\^ Ignore players, count is 1 for dealer's 2

Maybe it's common practice but I'm sure some people don't do that. Now the example are easy to count anyway, but when there are a lot of cards on the table, like when the dealer pulls aces and lows in rapid succession, it helps a LOT because you end up ignoring most of the cards. When that happens, I'm not counting his cards until he's finished, I'm just visually pairing them and count at the end

EDIT: Ew sorry Reddit messed up the formatting i'll fix it shortly"
blackjack,[count] Should I lower my base bet on negative counts?,"So I'm playing on an online table with rather standard rules:\[DAS, 3:2 BJ, 9/12 decks pen, 4 hands split max, late surrender, solo tables available, can split all and double all\]

TLDR: Keep base bet on negative counts, or divide it?

The biggest advantage is that the minimum bet is 10¢ (max is 10 000$). I'd say the only weaknesses are the 12 decks and the time to play isn't super long and doesn't reset on splitting hands, so you gotta know your shit and count fast. But I made a tool on my 2nd screen to keep track more easily so it's quite easy.

Oh, and I can switch to play money mid game without triggering a shuffle.

I used this table for a long time to practice basic strategy, then to learn card counting. I was actually doing it without varying bet size for a long time. I was just trying to become better/faster, playing with tiny (50¢) bets.

Somehow I made a (small) profit even without actual counting strategy, except switching tables if count went ridiculously low. I played about 16k hands so far on this site. (For beginners reading this: if you're wondering how long it takes to go from a complete beginner to 0 mistakes, it took me a good 12k hands, and I still glance at a table with the deviations from basic strategy depending on counts, so a long time, keep up the practice)

Recently, I started actually varying bet size and looking at bet strategies. But I think i'm doing something wrong.

My current bet strategy:

1 base bet at true count 0

2x base bets at TC1

3x base bet at TC2  (and so on up to infinity)

1/2 base bet at TC -1

Switch to play money at TC -2 (and lower)

&amp;#x200B;

Now I thought I was being super smart with the play money thing, although I expected to run out of it eventually, after which I was planning on just going 1/4, 1/8, etc. Maybe switch tables at very low count.

However, my play money stack is actually going up slightly. I'm baffled. Maybe the sample isn't large enough on the portion of hands at -2 and lower? But I could not find any strategies online that would actually lower the base bet at negative counts. I thought it was because of the minimum bet usually being 10-15$ and making it hard to have a base bet high enough to divide it at negative counts. But maybe I'm just a dumbass too.

Please enlighten me with your bet strategies. wwyd if you were me? Info on this is impossible to come by."

blackjack,myVEGAS multi-deck progressive blackjack and counting,"Hi all,

I’ve memorized the basic strategy charts, and I’m new to counting but do understand Hi-Lo. 

I’ve been playing the myVEGAS games for about two months now to rack up LPs for my wife and I’s first trip to Vegas. I notice when I play the single deck games it says shuffle after every round. Haven’t seen that on the multi deck game. Does anyone know how long it waits to shuffle? I didn’t know if it was worth counting (although there’s no discard tray to keep track of deck penetration anyway.) It’s not like I would stop playing if I couldn’t, it’s just me betting no actual money to get real rewards."

Coincidentally, if there's anyone around in the area that would be interested in practicing counting together, pm me. Working hard to get serious at it, would be great to connect with some like-minded individuals."
blackjack,The count is TOO high?,"This question is in regards to multi deck games. Is it possible for the count to get high enougn to be detrimental to you? Here’s my rationale:

There’s if the count stays relatively stable and within regular standard deviations, things are fine. 

But if too many low cards come out, which would normally be good for you (if counting), that would have to increase the density of high cards in the deck, but ALSO the density of high cards after the cut card right?


And reasonably, a high number of low value cards after the cut would be nice, albeit hard to track. 

But a high number of high cards after the cut would be detrimental, and this seems at least a little bit trackable. 

Is that a consideration that people make when playing? Or am I wrong?"
blackjack,Jack's in downtown Cleveland,"I'm a novice counter, steadily growing a bankroll from a small loan^tm from my dad. The Cleveland area is a bit lame on casinos with table games so we've became regulars fairly quickly at Jacks. The transition from stepping in to a casino for the first time and having to ask the dealer for help on basic strategy almost every hand to keeping the count and playing deviations properly has been such an odd experience but oh so satisfying. 


I've watched plenty of videos on how ploppies and gamblers at the table don't have a measurable impact on long term ev, and I figured if anything I would be helping everyone at the table by playing properly on a hand to hand basis. I would be crazy to not welcome the same sort of propper play from another counter right? 


Then I met *that* guy. Either he is new, or  he is bad at counting, I'm not a gambling man but I'd bet on the latter. He has sat at the same table as me a few times now and I can't decide on what frustrates me the most about him. 


To start, I think he might be the most obvious counter I have ever seen. He back counts for most part of an 8 deck shoe, or outright takes a table spot and will sit out a whole shoe to count, not even betting the $15 minimum unless its a running + 10. Each time he brings a bankroll of about $100 all in reds, and plays every hand like he is all in. He's annoyingly dramatic on obvious plays, like he has to think really hard about if he should hit that 14 against a 10. He takes so long on obvious decisions I think it's because he is too slow at counting he cant play and count at the same time. I'm sure he isn't playing from the start of the shoe because he can't keep the count while playing from the start. He tries to wong in and out, and I can respect the hussle I've tried to do similar before, but when someone is taking a spot in a mediocre shoe only playing 3 or 4 hands of the entire thing oh my fuck is that annoying. My favorite interaction between him and the dealer was when it was a +12 about 4 decks in, and he places the minimum for his first bet of the shoe. The dealer asks, ""What number do you have? I'll let you know if you're right."" Clearly flustered he tried to brush it off and play dumb but the rest of the table let some grins and smiles slip, he had been pissing us all off. 


I'm sorry to rant but oh my I couldn't stand him. There is a lot more to his play to lament, but I've gone on too much already. 

TL;DR - Don't be *that* guy."
blackjack,"Anyone play at boomtown in Biloxi,MS",I was wondering how many decks they use at their tables there
blackjack,No hole card - I'm not following?,"I'll preface this by saying I did search the sub briefly - the answers weren't really coming together for me so I figured I'd ask my own way.

I'm seeing the consensus that the absence of a dealers hole card should have no impact on basic strategy whatsoever. 

For examples sake, let's suppose a player 15 against a dealer's 8. Basic says to hit - I follow the logic if they've got a hole card- the single most likely outcome is there on 18! 
But if I hit, I'm looking for a 6 or fewer to avoid busting. If that 6 or fewer is indeed the next card in the deck, the dealer would find themselves anywhere from 9/19 to 14. So with the exception of an ace, they're hitting again from a pretty poor spot? 

Someone help me 😅 
There's two simple bits that I expect are clouding my logic; the first is that the mode average value is a 10 (being 4 of 13 outcomes) - the second is the average value of a given card is about a 7."

Other times its just back and forth tug-o-war with dealer. At certain point player fatigue sets in. The dealer can always be replaced and stays fresh.

blackjack,Four Blackjacks in a Row,"I saw a guy get a Blackjack back to back to back to back last weekend at Maryland Live. And the hand after that he got 11, doubled down and drew a ten for a 21.

What was funny about it is that there was another guy sitting at the table who was quite animated about people following proper strategy (not basic strategy because he clearly didn't know what basic strategy is). So just to mess with him, the girl next to me split tens which made the guy go bonkers. She split the tens after the 4-blackjack guy had already drawn 2 blackjacks, so when the obnoxious guy complained, I mentioned to him that the 4-blackjack guy wouldn't have drawn 4 blackjacks without the gal having split her tens. He then walked up and went to another table.

Looking up the odds, it appears that drawing four blackjacks in a row is about 1 in 160,000. Pretty cool to see."

blackjack,Mag 7s worth it?,"It’s $1 at the start of the shoe, has to be at the start of the shoe so you can’t count it. $10 for any suite, $100 for same suit, $15,000 for spades. If you don’t know what mag 7s are, it’s three 7s that makes a 21.

Edit: I realized that I am missing a lot of detail here. I’ll also add in some new discoveries I’ve found. In this variation it has to be your hand that makes the trip 7s 21. You can’t play off the dealer’s hand, if you split the hand it doesn’t work. This side bet lasts for the whole shoe instead of a single hand like other variations. In this case the more hands you get, the more you get out of the $1 side bet, heads up being the ideal situation. This next bit is all on the probability of the jackpot, since a large portion of the E[v] comes from this. Every 17 hands dealt there is a 98% chance of a 7 of spades being dealt and the probability changing. 17 hands at the initial probability equals out to slightly more in E[v] than the $1 bet. In this variation since you can’t make a hand off the dealer, you only realize half of this benefit. The next 17 cards before the next expected 7 of spades is dealt gives roughly $.8 in expected payout between you and the dealer. These first two cases add the most to the E[v]. I assume an average of 3 cards dealt per hand and I assumed that this low estimation would be canceled out by my conservative estimate for the probabilities. The probability improves every time a card is dealt and I used only the initial probabilities between each 17 card slug."

blackjack,"I've lost 12,000 playing blackjack","This is a message. That I vow never to play blackjack again. Ive played at some big name casinos such as MGM grand, Luxor, San Manuel, Morrongo, Venetian, Caesar Palace, so many more. There comes a time when you win, and for me I win big in the high limit tables and so forth. High limit or not, the truth was I convince myself so much that I can count cards, predict the deck, but I would either win or lose. In the long run! I continually win and lose, but I lost so much more. 

So this is a message, don't gamble.

blackjack,Blackjack Table Question ?,"Why are blackjack tables set up high off the ground, with players forced to sit in uncomfortable bar stool type chairs? There might be one table at regular table level for handicapped players in wheelchair.  But only one. Does that have something to do with security issues, so the casino can better keep eye on players?"
blackjack,Can one draw another card when hitting 21 one with 3 cards (or more)?,"This question bugs me since quite some time. I had 10 with my two cards, being the last box. All other tables had 17-19 and the dealers card we could see was a 5. There were as good as no 10s on the table.

I draw and receive an ace for 21 with 3 cards. I want another card as I thought most probably a 10 will come which would still give me 21. 

The dealer ignores me and unveils a 6 as his second card for 11 and draws a 10 for 21. 

The whole table loses and I have a stand off with the dealer. The thing is that the next cards would have busted the dealer and the whole table would have won (if I received my 10)

Now the question is as the title says. Are there rules regarding thid? I know that probably no sane person would draw another card with 21.


Edit: Also follow up question if I should have received the card, what to do in a case like that? ask for the videotape to be reviewed since I always make clear handsigns? There was not much money involved for me but I would be quite pissed if I had much money in it."
blackjack,Would you rather,"DD, 6:5, NS, DAS, DD on any, $25

OR

6D, 3:2, ES, DAS, DD on any, $25

CVCX tells me that the 6D is the better option by far, but I get higher counts more often with the DD, at least higher counts that I can capitalize on.

Is this all mental that I’m finding higher counts, spreading 1:4 with no heat, even moving to 2 hands for one hand and then back, and winning considerably more at the DD than at the 6D game?

I think the pit bosses care less because it’s 6:5.  This allows me to play aggressively without getting much attention.

The pen varies from 50% to 80% depending on the dealer at the DD game.  The 6D is about 70% to 80% consistently.

I know I should be doing better at 6D in theory, but in practice that’s not the case.  Will it all even out not in my favor in the long run, or are there really some advantages to a faster played low heat DD game?"
blackjack,Being backed off by local casino,"These are my day winnings in the last 4 days $400,$100,$100,$300. I always use my player's card. Will I be backed off by the casino, if I keep winning on a regular basis? 

I normally play $10 min starting with $200 and will raise my bet to a maximum of $30. I leave the table when I am up $100 or when I am down $100.

 I understand that the house always wins. I don't count cards. I follow basic strategy but sometimes deviate.

Since they know me, I can't say that I don't have a card.

blackjack,Games with good rules for counting in Vancouver?,"Just getting into card counting and looking for games in the Vancouver area that have good rules. I went to River rock to check it out and for the lower min bet tables they use a continuous shuffle machine. Maybe its a bit restricting that I don't have a big bank roll so playing $25 tables would be too expensive.. though they seem to have better rules (usually double deck).

From what I've seen/heard so far most of the low limit table here are hit on soft 17, 6 deck, multiple splits allowed, and even though there's no hole card, you would only lose your original bet on a dealer blackjack after doubling, splitting, etc. Any info would be great thanks!"

blackjack,Had a pretty good night at Maryland Live last night,"I walked in with $500 and cashed out $300. I had a pretty fun table and after a while I had roughly $700 accumulated. I should have just left then but my buddy was still going at it so I didn’t want to standby but also be part of the fun. I got a little cocky and started putting out $100/$200 bets and after a few hands I was down to $200. 

I waited a little bit to see how my buddy was doing. He came down to his last hand so I said duck it, and dropped the 2 black chips down. What startled me is that the dealer actually try to coax me to just walk away. But I insisted and put the money down. I got a pair of 8s and the dealer was showing a 3. So I took out the $200 cash I had l, traded it for 2 more black chips and split the 8s. Ended up with a 13 on the first hand and a 18 on the next hand. 

Dealer ended up flipping his other card and had a 2 bringing it to 5. Next card, 5. At this point she looked at me with some super sad eyes and dramatically pulled out the next card and... it was a 4! Next card, 8. For a bust!! I was soooo stoked! Turned $400-&gt;$800. Still shoulda walked away when I had the ~$700  accumulated plus the $200 cash  but it’s whatever. Still had a fun night"
blackjack,Best place to do blackjack in Vegas?,"I’m on the low side of intermediate in ability, and am going to Vegas to gamble for my 21st in some weeks, so I decided to slowly re-educate myself in what I learned playing casually with friends, and got to grips with some basic strategy well enough. Just curious which hotels are best for low-mid tier tables."
blackjack,Spanish 21's MTD bet is beatable.,"It's probly not worth your time as a card counter.  However as a gambler, keeping a very simple count can at least lower the 3%\~ house edge on the bet. 

The game we want is S17, 6 deck, with 4-1 payout on a match and 11/1 on suited match. (opposed to the 3/1 on a match and 12/1 in suited match)

&amp;#x200B;

Again this is not a strat for card counters to go and grind and make money, at least not yet its not.  Its just a way to play another game within a game while playing some Spanish and give yourself a little better chance to hit the MTD bet rather then just bet it every hand or never bet it at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

When the deck is imbalanced the odds of there being pairs goes up.  

&amp;#x200B;

 Consider a Spanish shoe with 144 cards remaining (half a shoe). If there are 12 of each card remaining, then the total number of rank-pairs is **792**. However, if the frequencies are {10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14} (10 cards each for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 14 cards for each of 8, 9, J, Q, K, A) then the total number of rank-pairs is **816.** 

 

In this count, I grouped the cards into two subsets of six cards each. One group consisted of the low cards **{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}**, which are given the tag **+1.** The other group consisted of the high cards **{8, 9,  J, Q, K, A}**, which are given the tag **-1.** If the true count is sufficiently positive, then a pair of high cards is more likely. If the true count is sufficiently negative, then a pair of low cards is more likely. For this reason, the “target true count” refers to a value that indicates both a positive and a negative target.

 \~Eliot Jacobson Ph.D 

&amp;#x200B;

At a count of +10 or -10 (true count) the bet is +EV, with about a 2% edge.  However even at a +6 or +7 the house edge is considerably reduced.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know my few hundred hands means nothing, but anecdotally, i hit the pair bet more when i count, and only bet +7 or -7.

Its a fun little side game and very easy to count because all cards have 1 or -1 value so cancelling happens most of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helps some spanish players hit the MTD a little more often. :)"
blackjack,"why not surrender 8-8 against a ten, also, why hit on 16 vs a 9?","Some of the odds are super close to one another that I am curious what the difference is. Now, I know you should NEVER change strategy based on bet side, but I do all the time to minimize loss. For instance, if I have a large overbet, and it's 8-8 against a ten, losing it could wipe out a giant portion of my bankroll. Minimizing my loss at this point is my best strategy, even if it's wrong. It's my understanding that you split 8's to get one over and one under the dealer, giving you a push because you have a hair better value when splitting. But the fact is, if you have an overbet from progressively raising and winning, risking double on potentially two 18's against a potential 20 dealer, seems foolish. 

Also if I surrender on a 16 v 10 dealer, should I also surrender on a 16 v 9D?"
blackjack,Still getting comps and mailers after a backoff,"Was told I was too good for the shop.  No blackjack, anything else was okay.  Yet they send me pretty nice comps for rooms, freeplays, etc.  Do the two departments not talk to each other?  Is your players card typically marked after a backoff?  I'd assume playing after being backed off with the same card would result in being trespassed.  Is there legit facial recognition that would get you identified for playing after a backoff? (without a card)  Or would an alert be set off that you are in the building when using comps on a card that has been backed off?"
blackjack,New to Blackjack.,"Hello, players.
So I kinda got into blackjack and started to go deeper in the forest here and there.
I am from Latvia. I'll tell you - only CSM tables in the country. Minimal bet 5€.

Okay, so far my playing plan is - 50x minimal bet to even consider playing /so 250€/, perfect basic strategy aaand... luck.
Last session was 3hr - from 250€ went to 165€ and took the loss. Took a dive since 1st hand, and was in the range of 190-220€ for at least an hour. :( 
One hard lesson i learned after 10+ drinks - NO ALCOHOL. Went from 100€ to 240€ then lost all on 3 hands. It was like 2h winnings lost in 20 seconds. Even though i was drunk, i used BS, it just made the money feel worthless...... Full table and drunk players making stupid decisions... What are your thoughts on those ""came to have fun"" peoples? Ever lost because of their decisions? 

Are CSMs actually favoring players, as the mother google says? Its said to give smaller house edge, or as i understood - when used with perfect BS the game goes 50/50 on odds?

Also, maybe someone can suggest a new blackjack book? I am halfway through Ken Ustons ""Million Dollar BJ"" but it just kinda feels ""outdated"". Not saying everything, just some stuff, you know, it was 80's... The book is great. It teached me a lot of good stuff.

So basically, its not possible to count cards here. Is it worth playing against a CSM? Though, i just came back from a 3 day cruise. The ship had 1 BJ table. 6 decks, cut 3. Dealer shuffle, player chooses how much to burn. Minimal bet 2€. Attempted to count Hi-Lo, sad to say I was a little too tired that day to keep a steady count at a full table, messed up after 6 rounds. It was loud too, there was a concert like 20 metres away. The session was kinda ""Up &amp; Down"". Luckily, after 2h, went away with what I began. Played until table closed.

By the way, any tips n tricks from you experienced guys? :)

Sorry for the random question sequences, the post looks weird. I have slept 12h in the last 4 days and have been under influence of strong water 90% of the time."

blackjack,Double deck sweaty?,"Obviously it varies greatly based on location, but, generally, do you guys feel double deck is much sweatier than a shoe?

Your bets jump more often (can't play it off every time as a ploppy pushing when winning, a degenerate chasing losses, feeling the shoe is getting hot, etc).

Easier for surveillance to count alongside you. They can probably see it from five hands instead of watching an entire shoe and getting lost in the counting system you're using.

Maybe it's a false observation, but in some casinos I see a bunch of mediocre shoe games and one or two double decks tables, which are too good to be true. I feel like casino figures ""if a counter comes in, he'll play this great double deck and not the shoe, so we can just mostly watch this.""

Thoughts, ideas? Is double deck worth it at a local spot, you wish to preserve?"
blackjack,Heads up or not when betting unit = table minimum?,"I understand the main reason for heads up being more advantageous is because you can play more hands per hour. The downside is obviously not really being able to sit out hands on negative counts. 

If a players betting unit is significantly more than table min (ie $50 unit vs. $5 table min) then you can easily bet table min at negative counts instead of wonging out and the effect on EV and ROR is nearly negligible since those hands are weighted 10x less. However, if your betting unit is equal to the table minimum and you are not wonging out, it's easy to see how this could eat away at your advantage and increase ROR.

So the question is - if you are playing with small betting units close to table minimum, does the gain in EV from playing more hands per hour offset the loss in EV from not being able to wong out at negative counts?"

blackjack,New to blackjack,What is the basic strategy of playing? If anyone can give me a run down
blackjack,Things to Consider for Beginning Card Counters,"I have been counting cards since February of this year. There are only a handful of shops that are within a 50 mile radius of my house, and I mix in all of them, mostly red chipping and playing rated to get comps and free bets. Just wanted to share with you all some of my comments and observations from the 80 or so hours that I have been doing this. I will admit that I still have a lot to learn, and my sample size is small. To some of you who are professionals, this will probably seem straightforward, but to someone who is thinking of starting out, these are some things to consider. Blackjack is a game that I have always enjoyed, but until this year, I didn't even have basic strategy locked down. It feels great to play a game I have always enjoyed but played with a big disadvantage, and turning that into a small advantage.

*  You will need to have a thick skin if you want to make it as a card counter. Some of those reasons are listed below.
* Keeping the count will be a challenge at first. I was not able to hold a conversation or concentrate on anything but counting when starting out, and still struggled to keep the RC. Just try your best playing the lowest stakes you can. Eventually, you will find that you can keep the count almost reflexively.
* There have been many occasions where I have won a significant number of hands with TC near 0. This is to be expected sometimes, as most hands played are at TC between +/- 1. I just keep making min bets until TC &gt; 1 and don't get too excited about results with min bets.
* When you are first starting out, it is scary getting out your max bet with high counts. You will also remember all the times you had a max bet out and lost a lot of money and question whether this actually works. Eventually this feeling goes away and you're excited to get your max bet out, and get less emotional about wins/losses. After all, you aren't counting with a goal of making min bets all day. 
* You will have to get used to getting berated for ""messing up the cards"" by doing proper BS moves like doubling A7 vs. 3. Add in hitting 12 vs. 4 with negative counts, and other index plays, and there will be many hands you will play in a given session that some people at the table will not like. I also like to add a hand when the count gets high, and have gotten yelled at for doing that as well. Just stick to your game and ignore the ploppies as best you can. If I am not playing in a hot shoe, I will usually leave and try to seek out a table that is empty or has less people.
* Be prepared to be surprised by how others play. I have seen people double hard 12 through hard 16, and stand on 12 through 16, regardless of dealer's up card. Gamblers like to go by how they feel, and how they feel varies from hand to hand. One time, they might double a hard twelve against a dealer 2, and the next time they might wave it. Do not worry about what they do, just play your hand(s).
* Tables with multiple side bets should be avoided if possible, as it usually takes a while for people to make change to place their side bets and for the dealer to pay out wins. Since my time is limited, I would rather play at an empty table with higher limits than play a slow game at lower limits.
* Ploppies and dealers will encourage you to play side bets, and some of them will do so aggressively. Some players will even try to play your side bet, and my policy is to not allow that. I then enjoy seeing the side bet hit and them getting annoyed because I am not a ""team player."" At least once a session I hear someone say something like ""the pairs always hit for the guy that isn't playing it.""
* Casinos are depressing. There are many people there that are slowly throwing away their retirement or gambling with rent money, and the casinos are all too happy to oblige. Most blackjack players bring a small amount of money relative to the table limits, lose it all relatively quickly, and only leave when they have no more access to money. As others have said, casinos like losers, and as soon as they feel you aren't a loser, you will no longer be welcomed."
blackjack,"Isn't it way more advantageous to play multiple hands? Context: Single-deck, 3:2 blackjack, DDAS allowed, hit on soft 17, no surrender, split on 10/11.","If I'm playing three hands, I can see more cards and can then make better decisions on whether to stand or hit. It feels like this would be strictly better than playing a single hand."
blackjack,Keeping stats,"Hey counters,

When I started playing, I made an Excel sheet where I kept track of hours played and money won (or lost). For a while, I thought that's all there is to it, but the number of columns quickly started expanding.

Hourly win rate

Comps: keeping track of comps showed just how much more generous some casinos are than others.

Wins/losses for every casino: I try to be low key in places , where I won a lot

Hours in each casino : don't grind one local place for too long

Deck penetration : some casinos are generally better than others, but I shit you not - sometimes penetration seems to change based on the day of the week. Some casinos are better on weekends and some week days.

Table minimums : some casinos never change them, but for some I found a pattern by day of the week and time.

Biggest losing streak per session: useful in creating a pattern, which educates me as to how much cash to bring with you into a casino. 

Once I bought CVCX, I started keeping track of EV, RoR and my bet spread for every session.

I know pit boss shifts would be useful to avoid ""old white Vegas looking guys"" and ones who, I felt, gave me heat. But it's too much work and I'm terrible with names. Same with dealers - there are some amazingly quick dealers, but fishtailing them seems like too much hassle.

Are there any other stats, you guys are keeping? Any other stats you believe are vital to success? Cheers!"
blackjack,Expected play time calculator,"Quick googling couldn't find this, but I assume someone here can point me to a resource or at least the math for this.

How long can one expect to sit and play blackjack, given the stakes, your bankroll, the number of players at the table and/or the average hands dealt per hour?

e.g. If my wife's got $600 at a full, $15 and the dealer averages 15 hands per hour, how long on average would it take her to bust out if she plays perfect, non counting strategy...I guess assume a 6 deck shute, but I don't know enough to know if that would matter for this calculation."
blackjack,Is this a large enough sample for win rate%,"I'm playing on an online table that has a great rule set. I was grinding games on it to practice decision making speed and making 0 errors without looking at a chart, using tiny bets. No counting, just basic strategy practice. I expected to be losing at a maybe 48% rate (I didn't calculate the edge), but I'm actually consistently making slooooow but steady gains.

I played around 5400 hands, and my net profit is about 1.8% of the total bets.

Is it possible that the sample is just not large enough and it will normalize back into losses, or am I dealing with either a bad rule set (for them) or a coding error?

It's a cryptocurrency based casino. So it's rather small. I deposit the same amount every session, then withdraw when I reach about 50% profit on initial capital, playing with 1/40th of said capital per bet. It dips, but clearly trends upwards.

Thanks for your insight."

blackjack,Losing count,"I’m getting into counting cards.  Local casino has an okay 6 deck shoe with surrender.  I can scan the table and count the cards quick enough, especially if I am not first base.  No issues there.  Where I lose the count is when I am hitting or the dealer is hitting, especially when a lot of small cards or aces are involved, because I am trying to accurately add the hand and the running count.  I have to add for the dealer too because once in a while they try to take my pushes.

What drills or techniques do you guys use?  I have experimented with stopping the running count while I/dealer is hitting, and then quickly pair up the hits for the running count.  So far only tried it at home but it doesn’t seem to be working for me."

blackjack,When your TC is +10 on DD do you split tens?,"Hi guys, a bit new at this thing but I wanted to get involved.

When playing DD and the TC is +10 and you get tens with the dealer showing say a 5/6 couldnt it be appropriate to split? Maybe even go as far as resplits until the TC is say around +5.

I have never split 10s but this seems like a logical bet.

There is a side bet at my regular casino ""bet the bust"" where you can play after the dealer shows there up card with 4/5/6 paying even money and 2/3 paying x1.5. I play the 6s on a TC +5 and play 3s if TC is +8.

Splitting 10s would be a better option than playing this side bet IMO.

blackjack,Really peculiar variant,"There's a BJ variant of the H17 sort. The big gotcha is that they offer you *free* doubles and splits in most common cases. Get a hard 11? Doubling it is free of charge and you keep the winnings. Or get a 9 pair, you split it on the house.  Aces too. And you can hit multiple times on aces.

The way they don't totally lose it is a rule: if the dealer busts on player's 17, it's a draw.

The return, they inform, is 99,36 % while in a normal BJ of S17 variant they have something like 99,55 %. 

I trust these numbers and thus won't waste my time on them but curious, have you ever seen such a variant? Really interesting if you ask me :)"

blackjack,Index plays edge,"How much of an edge do you gain with index plays? I dont necessarily want to play through negative counts, and will sit out when TC = -2 and come back in at least when the count is positive. I know the edge goes further into the casinos favor at negative counts, but how much edge do you salvage back hitting with basic index plays of 13 vs 2, 13 v 3, 12 vs 4, 12 v 5, etc when the index says to do so?"

blackjack,How to cope from huge loss.,I lost 400 today at the casino. I was doung good at first but couldnt stop playing and kept telling myself i was going to get that second tower built up and never really happened. Before i knew it was down to my last 10$ bet after 6 hours. Now my whole budget is messed up and i feel irresponcible. Left the casino with a feeling of anger and depression. Telling myself i need to be more strict about loss limits and number of hands i play in a day/a time. But telling myself to stay away from the game for a while but i know i will get the itch again. I have had other times i have turned a profit when i left but lossing 400 bones hurts. I was getting all the worst hands and worst luck possible. It was aweful. How have you guys delt woth these situations? It may even be better to go back to my 4 strikes rule with bigger wagers (i have normally won most that way from short short concentrated sittings) i play 100 percent bs but today it failed me.
blackjack,First time splitting 10s!,"Last night I went to the casino and played with a full table. I had put down a $50 bet when the dealer gave me two face cards while showing a 2. At this point I had already lost the exact count because I’m still new to this and am not the best at keeping track, but I knew the count was still positive and had a hunch that the next two cards were going to be high cards. When the dealer got me to me, he assumed I was going to stay, and as he was moving onto the next player I asked to split. Everyone at the table looked at me like I was crazy and told me not to, but I went with my instinct anyway, and put another $50 down. The first card I got was an ace and the second was a face card, so I ended up with 21 and 20. The dealer ended up getting a 5 card bust, so I also managed to help the others win their side bets. I’m not sure if that was the right move to make or not in that situation, but it was exhilarating and profitable nonetheless!
Do you guys have any other tips and tricks on card counting for a beginner? Thanks!"

blackjack,Basic Strategy edge cases,"Hi everyone, I recently found out about blackjack being one of the few games at a casino that the player can beat in the long run, so when I started looking into it I found all these resources such as **basic strategy** charts, card counting and shuffle tracking. Curious to see how these resources would work against casinos where I live, I decided to look up the rules they operate with and there are a few edge cases that I think are not included in most basic strategy charts or simulators, such as:

* you have to decide whether to count an ace as 1 or 11 for the remainder of your turn upon receiving one
* surrendering is only allowed if your hand (excluding aces) is worth more than 12
* only allowed to split twice (once upon receiving a pair, then only once more for each single)
* after splitting aces, receiving a 10 does not yield a blackjack but a flat 21
* dealer stands on 17 but it does not specify whether this involves a hard or soft 17
* insurance allowed (not sure if it is ever worth taking)

Although it would be nice if there were a website or program that could spit out strategy charts based on these rules, I am actually more interested in the mathematics of blackjack so I would love to be able to write a program which spits out basic strategy charts for any of the custom rules I add in the program.

Anyone got any ideas on how to get started?

Thanks and happy gambling!

EDIT: Here are the rules (as I understood them) from a pamphlet

1. Number cards have their numeric values, JQK are always worth 10, Ace is 1 or 11 (you decide unless specified otherwise?)
2. Dealer must hit on 16 and must stand on 17 (unclear whether hard or soft)
3. Surrendering is allowed if the dealer's upcard is NOT an Ace and your hand is at least 12
4. Doubling down is allowed if your hand is not a BJ, if the card is an Ace its value is always 1 and never 11
5. Splitting is allowed up to two times, A+10 becomes a 21 rather than a BJ
6. Insurance is allowed only if the dealer's upcard is an Ace
7. BJ pays 3:2"
blackjack,Tijuana Blackjack,"I recently asked about casinos in Tijuana: [https://www.reddit.com/r/blackjack/comments/crtd5a/tijuana\_casinos/](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackjack/comments/crtd5a/tijuana_casinos/) but no one was able to post any experiences.

I was able to get to one of the Caliente casinos recently and play a litle bit of blackjack. I cruised around the table games in the non high limit area and found that they had a lot of offshoot games like Spanish 21. There were also a few 6 deck shoes that may or may not have been regular BJ. The rules were in Spanish &amp; the tables were crowded so I didn't investigate those too much.

You need to get a players card first. Once you get that, you can go to the cashier and put the amount of money in Pesos on your card and pay in dollars. The exchange rate wasn't great (18.3 Pesos/USD vs \~19 at a decent exchange place) so it would be good to get Pesos somewhere else first if you can. You then give the card to the dealer and ask for how many chips you want. The chips of course are denominated in Pesos. The dealer swipes your card and gives you the chips.

I found a 2 deck game dealt from a shoe. The penetration was set by the dealer, no notch and it looked to be a little less than half a deck left behind the cut card. The table was a $10 MXN minimum with a $3,000 max. So basically a $5 - $150 USD table.

BJ paid 3:2 and insurance paid 2:1. It was an H17 game (dealer hits soft 17). You could surrender but I was told by another player you could not DAS. I assume that you probably can't RSA but not sure. They also had some lucky ladies type side bets. It was getting late so I only played for about half an hour. Next time I'll take a closer look at the 6 deckers.

Once you're done, you go back to the cashier and they give you back the chips you have left plus the $$ on your card. I got back Pesos but you might be able to ask for $US."
blackjack,Casino Verite Trial Version Accuracy?,"Just wondering how accurate the trial version of Casino Verite and also CVCX is. Reason for asking is that when I generate a strategy chart for a 6 deck, H17, DAS game, it gives me an index of 1 to double 11 v. A when i have known this to be a be a double even for playing BS. I figure this is an inaccuracy and I chalk it up to using the free trial version.

That being said, I was also using CVCX to help me calculate a betting strategy. I have found one that looks very appealing to me but am wondering if the numbers are to be trusted given it's the free version and the free version of CV has already shown an inaccuracy in the instance described above."

blackjack,I had the STEREOTYPICAL gambler at my table tonight,"Man oh man I just have to share with y'all. Every single stereotypical thing we discuss in this sub.

""I just play the vibe of the cards man. I know the strategy I know this shit I study it. Sometimes I just FEEL it.""

Absolutely unbearable.

*I hit a 12 vs a 2*

""BROO what are you doing you're only supposed to hit 12 vs a 3 NOT VS A 2 MAN""

His word for word strategy also was to NEVER hit 16 after he gets 3 cards. Let's say he had 10, 2, 4, he won't hit again vs A, 10, etc.

Splitting 6s, 7s, 8s vs 10s and As, too.

Every time I had a side bet win but I never played it, he would say ""C'MON MAN PLAY THE SIDE BET!"" This includes everyone at the table he's saying this to not just me.

It was just beyond comical. I lost $60 but I wasn't tripping. I play perfect BS but I don't count, I don't play enough or have the bank roll to benefit, I really just play for fun.

Unfortunately it wasn't as fun as it usually is, just because this guy ruined the playing experience, it was honestly tilting."
blackjack,"Playing multiple spots, variance, and bet spreading","Yesterday I was on a +7 shoe.  Absolutely gangbusters.  Everyone at the table was doing well, even the superstitious ones who put $25 down on their bet and $50 on the side bets (wow, talk about gambling haha).

My bankroll doesn’t permit me betting over $100 for my max bet right now.

Once I left the table, well in the black (though I had to work for it thanks to the previous shoe), I thought what if i had played multiple spots?

I know that when you get your max bet on the table, some people like to play a 2nd or 3rd spot to reduce variance.  So I would have played 2 spots at $50 each.

This is what confuses me.

Couldn’t I still play two spots at max bet of $100 *without outbetting my bankroll?*

(Currently playing Basic Omega II)

Technically, I would think the odds are the same whether I play one or two spots, right?  The cards fall as they do, and the count dictated me getting out my max bet.

Is the EV going to be the same if I max bet two spots instead of one?  Will I just be increasing my potential income per hour?

Thanks.  I’m sure there’s an easy answer, I just might need help conceptualizing it."
blackjack,Side bets and real gambling,"All through my learning I have heard to **never play side bets unless they are specific ones that can be counted or played with an advantage.** I won a side bet today on 3 way match.  I got 30:1 on $10 and got $300.

Exhilarating!  Now I love counting cards and realize that it’ll destroy my EV.  But sometimes I just want to gamble, dangit.

I’m considering never using my bankroll for side bets and just taking $100 or so out of my checking account before going to play, and using that money until it’s gone, or taking home what’s left or what it became.

Do any of you guys and girls do this?  I’m not good enough to count both the game and the side bet but I do occasionally have the disposable income to be able to “lose” $100 for nothing every once in a while.

I figure I will sometimes screw around at roulette or slots if I’m there with my friends and not counting.  Do you all ever “gamble” in casinos at the same time or in the same trip that you count?"
blackjack,11 v. Ace playing deviation,"I've had some confusion around this playing deviation. I was under the impression to for H17 you always double down on 11. But I've heard people say at a count of +1 you are supposed to double down on 11 v. ace instead of hit. Is this just a difference between H17 and S17? If so, does this deviation apply to H17 or S17?"

blackjack,GTA Online BS: splitting tens?,"Grand Theft Auto Online's casino uses 4 decks in a CSM and stands soft 17. It also treats a 2-card 21 after splitting aces or tens as a blackjack, paying 3-2, even when the dealer draws into 21.

I'd like a bet spread that has fairly low risk because I like to play the game and I'm still learning a bit. It is fine to just choose something random like +1-$5, +2-$10, +3-$15, +4-$20, +5-$30, +6- $40? I plan to do a lot of backcounting and wonging so I don't whittle away all my money from rents."

blackjack,Questions about soft totals when you can't double down,"For soft 17 you double on dealer 3-6, hit otherwise. Soft 18 you double 2-6, stand on 7 or 8 and hit on 9-A. I was wondering if you have already taken your 3rd card or more and you are in a situation where you would normally double down, do you hit or stand? For example, the dealer is showing a 4, you have a soft 14, hit it and end up with a soft 18. Do you hit on stay in this situation? Another one, the dealer is showing a 3, you draw a soft 15, so you hit and get a soft 17. What do you do now?"
blackjack,Does the count affect basic strategy or just your bets?,"I was wondering if it is ever statistically justifiable to depart from basic strategy based on the count.

blackjack,Recent Unfortunate Casino Visit,"hey guys! first time posting to the sub. i'm 19 and i've recently started playing blackjack and practicing my counting. im from Montreal and we have an interesting setup at our casino. i started playing on live machines in a big room of like 100 podiums where there is a dealer/entertainer at the front, with a $5 min. it had great rules and i made good cash (left a few times having won $500-$1000 with a $100 buy in) but it got boring once i got basic strategy down. also - max bet was $100. 

so once i was confident enough i started moving to the real tables. got caught by 6:5 tables in my first few visits to my local casino (once i started betting &gt;$25 the dealer told me how i shouldn't waste my time and money on the floor i was on - upstairs had $25+ games that are all 3:2). 

anyways i've been 9 or 10 times now and i've fallen IN LOVE with the game. we have a few free bet tables in a nice little corner that has windows (rare in a casino) and a terrace for breaks. 

last week i went with a $200 bankroll - i know this is no where near enough for proper counting but im mostly playing to learn and have fun right now. a short 2 hours later i was sitting with $4.5k in chips. i had been tipping generously and buying drinks etc so although heavy, the heat wasn't too bad. it was kind of crazy to finally feel what people were talking about on here... the pit boss kept looking over and did not look pleased as i free-split my $600 bet and then doubled going on to win both hands netting like $1800 from one hand. 

ANYWAYS - i had to get back home to meet a friend around \~9, and it was about 8:30 so i told myself i'd step outside for a quick break and to finish my drink then play one more hand. 

after my break i went back in, and had 4 white chips (1k), 4 blacks and 4 greens. i told myself id play with the greens and then leave. long story short, i got totally out of control, started betting table max (1k) after having lost 4 or 5 hands in a row (increasing bets on each one) and ended up walking away with my measly $200. i didn't feel that bad because i left no poorer than before and got a few drinks/tips for the dealer in, but losing 4k in 90 seconds didn't feel great. the dealer and pit poss were containing their laughter but im sure they gutted themselves once i left. 

lesson learned: play conservatively, dont make crazy bets and don't assume that because you've lost 4 hands you will DEFINITELY win the next. it was a thrilling night either way :p"
blackjack,$250 in 5 minutes!,I did an experiment today where i went to the casino with 100$ and got 4 green chips (25s) and said to myself will do 25$ bets and only stay until i lost just 4 hands. Thats exactly what i did and the result was me leaving the cashier with $350! It felt so good. Just wanted to share that experience with you guys.

-H17

-BJ pays 3:2

-Insurance 2:1

-Resplit up to 4 hands

blackjack,Looking for some help with bet spread as well as a question about playing multiple hands.,"I've put in a lot of hours lately brushing up my skills on counting and I feel like i'm almost ready to take it to the casino. One of the last things is figuring out a betting scheme to use. I've taken peoples advice and tried to use CVCX to help figure some things out but either I am missing where I run sims or it's not available in the trial version. Perhaps someone one here could chime in.

My rules would be H17, DAS, LS, No RSA, 6 deck. I am currently using Hi-Lo. Bankroll assumed to be 5k but is replenishable. I was thinking of using a 1-12 spread with $5 units. With a scheme such as:

TC&lt;+1 - 0

TC&gt;+1 - 1

TC&gt;+2 - 2

TC&gt;+3 - 6

TC&gt;+4 - 8

TC&gt;+5 - 12


I guess my question - would this be profitable? Any recommended changes? Also on a related note, I have been using a phone app that recommends playing 2 hands at +4 (each with the same bet as +3 had). I looked into this and it doesn't seem like it offers any EV improvements over just playing a single hand with a bigger bet. However, it might offer some benefits in terms of reducing variance? Could anyone comment?"
blackjack,First time playing in Europe,"Last night I went to a casino in Germany, first time playing in Europe. I am curious if it’s a different basic strategy, that’s what I play. Just went for fun.

Reliably in 99% accuracy with basic strategy, reliably within a couple points a shoe with basic Zen Count, and have tracked good hand streaks to being up over 10k on my original 1k buy in with CV. 

So while in Vegas I've now had 8 bad shoes in a row.  Always the same, always lots of tens to get started then trickling back to barely 0 by the end of the shoe except for on two.  Those two had a hand or two of +1 true count, which I took advantage of, and made a bit of my money back, but then back to negative for the rest of the shoe.

blackjack,The Dealer called me stupid,"I was playing Blackjack at Tropicana Evansville.
I was with a friend of mine and 3 others, me being in the middle. The dealer's name is Joyce and she was probably the worst dealer I've ever seen, honestly. She seemed to enjoy seeing people lose money, which I had never experienced before. She was also very rude and almost arrogant. Despite the dealer having a negative personality, everyone was having a great time playing the game.

We're about halfway through the shoe and I place my $75 bet in. I draw 2 face cards and the dealer shows a 4. I notice nobody else has a hand above 15, the woman next to me having 11. I tell my friend that I am considering splitting. My friend knows I love splitting 10s and encourages the risky play. Everyone looks at me like I'm crazy. I ask everyone playing if that is okay and everyone says yes. Okay, I'm doing it.

Player 1 stands at a 12 I believe

Player 2 doubles her 11 and draws a 7

I still have the only face cards and an ace hasn't made an appearance in a while.

My turn; I throw another $75 on the table and signal for a split. The dealer looks me in the eyes and says ""you're really stupid""
I had never heard a dealer say that. She didn't say it was a bad move, she directly insulted my intelligence. Now I got pissed. 

I said ""We'll see, watch this. You're gonna give me a face and an ace. My friend is gonna stay at 12. The woman on the end is gonna draw a 10, and then you will bust.""

Silence.

She draws my card. Ace. 
21. Wave
She draws again. King.
20. Wave

My friend (player 4) waves.
Player 5 hits and draws her 10 and waves.

Dealer flips over 6 with her 4.
10.
Dealer draws 5.
15.
Dealer draws 8.
23.
Dealer busts. Everybody wins.

Player 1 adds everything and says ""she would have gotten 21 if you didn't split those 10s. She would have beaten us all."" 

The fact I had won wasn't all that surprising, but when he made me realize that my decision to split my 10s was the only reason we won, I was astonished. I couldn't even tell you how low the odds of this happening were. This story almost wouldn't be possible to retell without my roommate witnessing it all unfold. It truly felt like a scene out of a movie, but would probably be dramatized and have a much higher wager on the table for every person involved.

Edit: I should have expected the circle jerk of ""never split 10s""
The point of the story was that this was the instance that it not only worked, but was the only scenario that saved every single player."
blackjack,Any tips to make counting easier?,I get tripped up going down in the negatives so I just start at 100 then go up and down from there. Seems easier to me then a 10 is always a lower number like 95 94 93 not as tricky as -5 -6 -7 to me. Any other ideas?

blackjack,Card counting with only 3 casinos,"Hi all,
I live in the northeast with only 3 casinos within driving distance (MGM springfield, Mohegan, Foxwoods). Is it worth learning to count if there are only 3 accessible casinos to play at? Would being backed off of the casinos essentially end the opportunity to make money counting?

Also, I’ve been reading huge variations in hourly EV ($10-$400). I am planning to play BJ on the side (8-10hrs per week). Do you need to be a full time card counter to reach the high end of EV or just have a large bankroll?"

blackjack,Automatic VS CSM card counting,"Okay so if my knowledge is correct, Automatic shufflers are just machines that shuffle the shoe whereas CSM are shufflers that continuously shuffle dealt hands into the shoe rendering card counting useless? 

If this is the case, I saw through videos that Automatic Shufflers require a player to choose and insert a red card into the shoe which determines when the machine is getting shuffled. 

Wouldnt this allow for the player to just place the card at the farthest back point to allow for the majority of the shoe dealt? 

I'm sorry if I got this entirely wrong, I just want to prepare myself for being able to determine the right amount of decks left for counting. 

Thank you!"

I placed a £29 bet - 

side bets i put £5 on a 21+3 pair and i think £4 on a partner pair? (I dont know what these mean i get i needed matching pairs)  I got two black aces, the dealer was congratulating me. I got insurance incase he had BJ im not even sure if i hit (yes i am this clueless) he turns over his card and he's laughing and saying wow. 

Next thing it says you have won £604!!!!

blackjack,Blackjack and travel,"Hey fellas,

I've been counting at my local casinos for some time now and am now considering doing a travel/blackjack trip with a friend. The idea is: drive or cheap flight + rental. Cheap hotels and, if lucky, snatch a couple comp'd nights by asking after playing. Should be under $1,000 in expenses per person. We're thinking of traveling for about 10 days; spend two or three sightseeing and the rest playing full time. Really, we're just looking to have good time, play blackjack with no fear of backoffs and generate some EV.

I've traveled and I've card counted before, but I've never combined the two. Few questions that pop up:

1. What bank roll would justify it without an insane RoR? We figured that combined bankroll of $40,000-$60,000 with 2% RoR or less would, in theory, generate enough EV to cover expenses and then some. Is it good enough? Do we need more? Can we get away with less?

2. We are in US. Traveling and, especially flying, could get sketchy with over $10,000 on your persona. Withdrawing/depositing big sums in your bank account in cash is also ill-advised. How could you get around it? Is it a good idea to call the casino and ask for assistance in transporting the funds? Is driving the better option than flying?

3. Might be a silly thing to ask at the end of it, but.. where to go? Oregon/Washington seem like lovely places if the trip is in the summer. New Mexico/Colorado also seem like good options and more realistic for avoiding flying. Really just looking for a nice place to visit and play on the western side of the US. Need to keep in mind quality of casinos of course. 

I do understand that nothing is guaranteed and there's almost as good chance of losing as there is of winning on this trip. We think in terms of whether generating EV in casinos, we can burn, would justify leaving the comfort of the ""casinos down the street.""

I would GREATLY appreciate any thoughts and opinions, based on math or personal experiences. Cheers!"

blackjack,New player questions,"Ok, a quick backstory.  Wife and I know the basics of blackjack. We decided we wanted to start playing in the casinos so thought it smart to learn all we could on the game. In doing so, we got ourselves some cards (8 decks) and some chips (to make it more realistic) and take turns being the dealer.  In doing so, we came up with some questions. Yes, very basic ones I suppose for someone that's played a while, but I can see other new players not knowing all the answers. With that said...here goes...

&amp;#x200B;

1. When the dealers face up card is a 10, does he look at his/her hole card at the beginning and if total is 21 game over? I know the rules on an ace with insurance, but not if it's a 10.
2. If all the players bust, does the dealer continue to deal cards to him/her self? Or is the game over at the point of all players busting?
3. On a split hand, does the player get one card on each of the split cards and then play the first one, or play out the first split card then receive the second card on the other?

Again, I know these are basic questions, but I just don't know.  And I am sure I will have more. LOL

He said I remember you too, and then said card counter under his breath. I played for a bit and left.

Second, at a different casino, I put out a 150 bet, way higher than what I normally bet because running count was +5 and true was +3.5 or +4. I saw a pit boss go through the discard pile, like they wanted to see if I knew what I was doing. I lost that hand and am wondering if that's why I wasn't backed off.

blackjack,Counting: insurance," Simple question, would prefer cited answers if possible if you know where to find it in BJA or somewhere else.   Do you take insurance based on the count for the round, ie what the count was at the start of the deal, or after the cards have been dealt?  I’ve run into this often enough where the count drops to slightly below the index during the round that it got me curious how close the ev difference is.  Thank you."
blackjack,New Counter in 2019 - Software and Training Tips,"Hello All,

I am writing this post to get a gauge of how card counting is doing in 2019. From what I have read it is thriving provided you have the Bankroll to sustain the long haul. That being said I have been getting into practicing counting at home (Hilo) and separately learning basic strategy. Surprisingly enough I taught my GF the Hilo, and her brain counts and processes much faster than mine, lucky her! 

At this point I have decks I have been counting with at home but cannot rely on my own count without going back and recounting to see if I was right, which brings in the wonderful world of technology. 

I know of the software Casino Vérité which is my understanding to be gold standard to learn and perfect. I was wondering how many have used this, and if you have are you a successful card counter because of it. I also know of Blackjack Apprenticeship who seems to have a platform of their own. I do enjoy Colin’s videos and his information and honesty. However, if I am going to dive in headfirst and commit 200 hours of my time minimally to get to 100% I do not want to waste time on a training solution that brings me only 90% of the way there. I know Colin is active on here as well so if he sees this post I’d love his input as he has endorsed CV and obviously owns BJA.

Another note is I’m based in NJ and an hour away from AC so if anyone has a go to spot in AC that you recommend I’m open to hearing it. I don’t plan on putting a chip on the felt until I am 100%."
blackjack,What is an Acceptable Basic Strategy House Edge?,"I purchased the current issue of Blackjack News and they have a column that is the house edge over the player if you play correct basic strategy. My question is what edge is too much edge? 0.50%? 0.60%? Unfortunately Atlantic City as I am coming to terms with averages a House Edge using basic strategy, and low roller ($10 units), 8 Deck shoes, of 0.66%. There is one Casino and 5 tables in it that offer 6 Deck, Stand Soft 17, Resplit non-aces to make 3 hands, and double down after split, which only has a 0.42% advantage over player using basic strategy. I'm sure counters fight to get a seat there. Now I can understand why Colin of BJA told me on another post that AC Sucks haha"

blackjack,Topping off each bet with a nickel,"I am playing around with a 1-12 bet spread on CXCV and I was wondering...with having a $10 min bet, would topping off each increased bet with a nickel avoid heat in any way or would it just aggravate the dealer?  For example, bet $10 at TC&lt;0, $30 at TC = 1, $55 at TC = 2, $80 at TC = 3, and 2 hands of $60 at TC&gt;= 4."
blackjack,The place I play has a “high limit” area with table minimum of $100. I’m a casual player but I usually don’t bet less than $100 per hand but only stick to “regular tables” with a minimum of $5-$25. What are the benefits of high limit rooms? Any different/special rules?,
blackjack,"When to Wong out, or walk away with a loss/win","I've been using Verite to trial a slightly modified balanced count, the results are good, but, say once in every 10 shoes I find myself in a tailspin to a huge loss and need to control this, so am keen for your thoughts as to when you personally stop playing a shoe-either because you're up and think that's the point you want to walk away, or, you're down and you think it'll head further south. Or do you even just keep playing and what will be will be?

&amp;#x200B;

My example:

I'm averaging an EV per shoe (this is after around 200 shoes on Verite) of around 3 units. With an average loss of around 6units and an average win of around 10units. Now whilst playing, and ramping up my bets on a high count, I find that sometimes I hit my current max of 10x min stake. And if I miss on those hands, my bankroll can be decimated. About 1 in 10 shoes I seem to stumble across one of these shoes where the count is great, I get my money out, but just miss - you know the deal, dealer get 20, and I usually get dealt a 12 or a 14 and bust it. I get these for consecutive hands and my bankroll goes from looking at making a couple of units, to be being down 20,30,40,50 units.

&amp;#x200B;

I know counting is an exact science and there's always the chance that the maths says get your money out, but you still dont get the hands - what do you do in these situations? Do you stop playing even though the count is good? do you stop playing the shoe when you're down x units?

As a test a couple of times of continued to play through with a high count when I'm just not hitting the cards, and found my entire bankroll wiped out on verite. But on the flip side, I quite often find myself down 15x units and fully recover on a good count.

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas of how you manage losing streaks appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Btw, I'm talking on a purely per shoe basis here. Not if you're having a nightmare session overall."

Blackjack is offered, included with all of PA's player friendly blackjack rules like standing on all 17s and BJ pays 3/2... If a player were to stick with 5-10 dollar bets with perfect strategy, how much of the 1k bankroll will be expected to be left over once 10k in play is reached(doubles and splits are included)? At that time, everything above 500 will be considered profit"
blackjack,How realistic are blackjack gaming apps compared to real life?,"Hi so I am 17 and I began playing blackjack since a few months ago when I played it on Red Dead Redpemtion 1. After some games there I downloaded a Blackjack 21: Blackjackist from the app store. 

It took me a few months to realize this but I noticed my luck on Red Dead was always terrible. But with my blackjack app on my phone, my luck has been way more better but obviously still challenging. I always play the max bet I can place for the table because it feels like theres minimal risk. Obviously if this was real money I would not be so risky, but the game I play feels like its not a realistic way to play blackjack as the odds seem more favorable to the player than the app. 

I am no card counter so I have no way to know if the decks being played are altered to prevent card counting. So I came here to ask how realistic these online games like ones I play are too real life. I am talking about games like on an app store and not online gambling. However if you know about both spectrums I'd love to hear a comparison about it."

blackjack,Curious about CSM and single decks video blackjack,"First off let me say I’m not a card counter nor a professional gambler. I go with a set amount I’m willing to lose and enjoy just the ride while playing.

But I have been thinking about how a to count a video bj game. My theory is count the machine hand by hand and hit/stay/dd based on count with new odds given the count. I’m sure this has already been discussed so if you know exactly what I’m talking about don’t read the rest I’m just explaining my theory.

So since there is only 1 deck then the odds of getting a card you need is good. For example.

5 people at table you/dealer/3players. That’s 9 cards and around 17% penetration. So for example dealer shows a 9 and you have 10, most odds you should dd. Now what if there are a lot of high cards delt out (I would guess you would want to be last to delt to get better penetration) would you still dd vs a 9 if the count is +2 or 3 or would you just hit because the odds aren’t in your favor to get a high card.

I’m thinking that my theory is incredibly flawed and unfeasible because casinos would have had to came up with a way to prevent this, but still curious to know."

blackjack,Advantage(s) of no-hole card blackjack?,"I read online only about the disadvantage of ENHC, mainly the split/DD disadvantage, but from my experience (I play online, single deck/hand no-hole) I’ve found it to be preferable, at least psychologically, to have no risk in hitting bad hands because the dealer would win anyway with the next card. For example, if I have a hard 12 and the dealer has a 10, I hit and get a 10, I would’ve lost regardless. So it makes it easier for me to hit because in hindsight hitting is always the right thing to have done. I’m not an expert and I wouldn’t be surprised if my logic is mathematically flawed. But if I had to pick, I would choose no-hole over the alternative."

blackjack,KO count to true count conversion,I was playing some blackjack yesterday at the casino. I always use the KO count and Wong in when the RC is 23+ ( I play 8 decks and start my RC at 0). I saw an amazing count of 24 at 2.5 decks in. What was the true count at that time? I figured it would be 24-10 ( to substract the sevens) / 2.5 = 5-6 TC. is this right? Anyway I did play that shoe and ended up 3 units.
blackjack,Casino comps,"
Last night I went to my local casino.. first I bought in for 400 at the craps table and spent about an hour over there, $10 table, not betting anything crazy so I wasn’t really expecting a lot of points from there.. average bet was like $10-$20.  Walked away with $364 after tipping the dealers $5... then I went to a $10 blackjack table.. long story short, walked over there with the $364, ended up buying in for another $200 a few hours later.  Spent 10 hours there, averaging about $50 a hand.  I had to have played close to 1000 hands.  Hovered around even then went south.. Took me 8 hours to get +100.. eventually I put $500 to the side and figured as long as I only lost $100, I would have made up for it in comps.. 7:30 am rolls around and I’m at $500 (probably could have gotten back up to even if I stayed another hour or two but I was exhausted).  As I was walking out, I check my points and I only gained about 1000 points which is $10 in comp points, no vouchers, no other comps, free rooms,etc...doesn’t this seem kinda low?  Doesn’t seem right that you’re playing for that long with a pretty decent average bet and they only give you $10 worth of points.  Do you guys think they made a mistake?  Should I speak up about it?"

blackjack,Lost a $400 bet yesterday. What would you have done?,"Ok.  I think I did the right thing, but want to ask “what would you do?”

I sit down at my first table.  New shoe.  6 deck.  Good rules.

$200 seem to fly out of my pocket and onto my third base betting circle as if the bills were as valuable as parking vouchers that needed validation.  Not my whole bankroll for the day.  Not even half.

Let’s play some blackjack.

I begin the necessary tradition of trading min bets back and forth with the house while (surprisingly) keeping a good count (I’m still very new at this).

Small cards begin to appear.

Check the discard tray.  Half deck.  Who cares.

Keep playing.

4s, 5s, and 6s abound.

2 decks down in the pack.

Am I at +10?  What’s that?  True 2?  Ok.

Up to $50.

True 3...

Here’s $75.

Cleaning.

How front loaded can this deck be?  I look down at my doubled stack of quarters 15 minutes into my first session.

$100 out.  I’m going to lose.  I’m going to need to check more cash.

+20, 3 Decks in the discard tray.

I’m at a true 6.  Holy shit this deck is gangbusters.

$150 slides into the betting circle.  The pit boss walks over and watches.  Meh.  Shut up dude, I’m on a roll.

Now $150 is my max spread on a 1:6.  I feel like the count went a *little* over a 6 at one point.  And I’m now dripping in green chips.  $800 to be exact.

Out goes $200.  The count dictates it though my spread doesn’t.

I draw an 11.  Dealer showed below 7.

I start to think.  I begin to sweat.  With little hesitation I put $200 next to my bet and one extremely nervous index finger on the table.  I know the count is high as hell, I *should* catch a 10.

Draw.

3.

“Effffffffffffffffff”

Dealer turns up his down card, turns a stiff hand into a pat hand.  Apologizes, and scoops away $400 of damn hard earned money.

I fake being more upset than I actually am.  I know that’s how this game works.  No hunches.  No luck.  Just extremely unforgiving statistics and correlations.

I finished the shoe up $200, and sighed **somewhat** relief.  What a roller coaster that 30 minutes was.

This was my first experience with an extremely plus shoe.  I would like feedback if possible.

I believe I did the right thing in knowing the count, strategy, and bet spread, though I overplayed it.  Should I have not gone above $150?  With the count so high I broke the glass ceiling on my usual spread in an attempt to gain more money.  But I could have walked away $300 up...

Would you have done that on an 11 against a potential stiff hand with a plus 5-6 shoe?

Thanks in advance, and thanks for reading!"

I have not paid for blackjack apprenticeship, (and most likely won't) however, how fast do you  think someone would need to be able to count a 6 deck shoe on their practice site, in order to be fast enough to count a shoe at a casino? I can count a 4 deck shoe at the 2 second speed on their website. This means it waits two seconds after the last card was dealt to deal again.

blackjack,My first blackjack experience at a casino as a “counter”,"Let’s start with the reality:

tl;dr - I have questions at the end.

I played at one of the only two casinos in Maine.

-	I know the HiLo count, but began learning the basic omega II a week ago
-	I know basic strategy perfectly
-	I don’t know how to properly bet spread using the omega II and just used (very poorly) a simple 1-10 or 1-12
-	I went with $600 being OK with losing it all
-	I came home with $327.50
-	I made many many stupid mistakes
-	I lost count of all but almost one full shoe of a double deck game

The games:

**Game 1**

1.	6 deck, ASM, 3:2
2.	60% pen at best
3.	$5 min
4.	poker side bets
5.	DaS, RsA, NS, DoA, H17 (i think)
6.	all cards up but dealer hole card

Impressions and takeaways:

-	the pen was terrible at a consistent 60-65%.  I kept looking to see if they had cut card markers on their shoes, but I didn’t see any.  They were just that consistent at screwing their clientele.
-	everyone played the side bets, I never did.  But it seemed like people were actually *profiting* off of them.
-	my counting was good when my playing was slow, and my playing was good when my counting was bad.  I think this gave me away as I would be so busy doing maths in my head that when the dealer got to me (I sat at 3rd base at every table) I would look a little startled or almost unprepared.  Then look at my hand, look at the dealers card, and inevitably make the right decision.  About 10 hands into my first table I believe I made a rarer double play; the dealer yells to the pit boss “HEY WALLY!  We got a cheatah heah, he’s countin’!”  (I’m in Maine, so read that like a Mainah).  He said it in a joking way and they both laughed and he continued dealing.  But I knew it wasn’t a joke.  He could probably see my mental wheels turning on everyone else’s hand and me not really caring about mine (or acting like it) until it was my turn.  Not a great start.  More on my poor camouflage later.

**Game 2**

1.	2 deck, hand shuffled, 3:2
2.	Consistent 50% pen
3.	$10 min
4.	poker side bets
5.	NO DaS, double on 9,10,11, NS, no resplit, H17 (i think)
6.	all cards down but dealer upcard

Impressions and takeaways:

-	The pen was god awful at a “mandatory” 50%
-	It was much harder to count when all cards are dealt down, and I also had never practiced that.  My eyes were darting around everywhere.
-	Again, everyone seemed to play the side bets and win.
-	With a full table we only got about 3-4 hands before a reshuffle and I don’t remember ever counting above a true 2.

**The Dealers**

This is the real reason I came to the casino.  I experienced 5 different dealers in the 4 hours i was there, and they were all different.  Now I *know* that if you go to a casino without being able to count and play perfectly, you are going to lose.  My experience further proves that statement.  But the knowledge I gained from being dealt real blackjack at a real casino was well worth the price I “paid” (remember I still had fun!).  So, if you’re still reading this post, thanks for hanging in there, and I really hope you can provide me with insight and answers to my questions as I am very excited to improve at this game.

Here are all 5 dealers in the order I met them with fake names because I can’t remember them, if you read about an issue I explain here and know a solution, please let me know!

1.	Schmo - Schmo was a bad dealer, in the most literal sense of the term: he flipped cards on top of each other, one even landed on top of the house chips at one point.  He’s also the one that “caught” me counting (or trying).  A very loud, slow dealer, he often gave playing advice to everyone.  And the advice was plain wrong.  “ALWAYS double when you have 10.”  More hilarious phrases like this about splitting.  It was very obvious that he was trying to get more money on the table for the house to snatch away.  He attempted to join in the game with us, but not in a good way.
2.	Linda - Linda relieved Schmo for his scheduled 20 Minute break so he could go chain smoke Cowboy Killers like it was going out of style (no complaint here, I smoke).  If Schmo were a good example of a less than desirable blackjack dealer, then Linda was the opposite.  She walked up, burned the top card in the shoe, smile, nod, swept her hand gracefully from right to left and then retraced the path in reverse.  She dealt like a machine and never really spoke a word, just the occasional gentle “good luck” on a double or “nice job” on a win.  I lost count almost immediately.  We were doing a hand every 30-45 seconds with 5 of us at the table.  I was scared to slow down the flow of the table and make it obvious that I was doing something *other* than playing blackjack and enjoying myself.  I had to get up.  Nothing was working for me, though everything at the table was running like a well oiled machine.
3.	Jessica - a cute little Mainer with a flower keeping her hair behind her right ear, standing stoically in front of a perfectly fanned double deck.  I sat down.  Who wouldn’t?  Her glassy stare turned into a genuine smile as she tossed a cut card my way and yelled “checking 100!” to the pit boss as she took my $100 bill from the betting circle.  She dealt the cards face down.  Didn’t see that coming...  picked them up.  Looked at hers, and motioned for a draw.  “Actually, you have to scratch your cards on the table towards you to take a hit.”  “Oh...”. I sheepishly cat scratched my hard 12 against the felt.  More people came, and again.  I instantly lost count.  It’s much easier to count from 3rd base when the cards are up.  Everyone at this table was turning their cards over at different times, or not at all until the dealer quickly flipped them as a formality before collecting them.  And when the whole table broke, she would flip her hole card so fast and put her upcard right on top.  She didn’t talk much, but when she did it was sarcastic.  Being my charismatic self I tried getting her to cut a little deeper than 50%, but all my jokes, tokes, and hints were met with “I have to cut at 50%, I’m sorry.”
4.	Fred - sitting back down at 6 deck I put two nickels in my betting circle right as it closed up.  No eye contact.  He dealt all the way to the woman to my right, knuckled my bet out of the circle, shook his head, and kept dealing.  Not knowing how to react I simply waited until the hand was over and returned my met to its previous position.  He looked over, nodded, and smiled saying “now you’re good.”  Whoops...  Fred ended up talking toward the end of the shoe but didn’t really talk about blackjack, just his life.  It was cool I guess if you’re there to have fun and make friends, but I wasn’t.  On the flip side however, he gave almost no betting advice to anyone, and I think this really helped the flow of the game.  I had the most fun playing with Fred dealing.  It was fast, light hearted, he never “struck up conversation” with a pit boss, so no one was watching, he seemed to **genuinely** not give a shit when I jumped 10 units from $10-$100, and then split on that hand, and had $200 on a table with a $5 minimum (with a $500 bankroll...  yeah...  I guess I like playing Russian roulette with my money, I was also betting emotionally, as I was frustrated at my sudden inability to count to 10 and -10).  This dealer seemed apathetic to the goings on at his table, and I’d definitely play there again.
5.	Carla - Carla was absolutely unremarkable.

My mistakes:

1.	I played stupid with Schmo in the beginning before sitting down, then played too well (relative).  He thought I was so novice that he was recommending plays to me.  He caught on when he would deal me a hard 11 and before he could tell me to double I had my chips added and one finger on the table.
2.	I almost deviated from basic strategy.  Just the thought of doubling, say, a 9 against a 7 upcard when the deck was a little plus was enticing.
3.	I should have stuck with HiLo this time around, which I knew I could play better.
4.	I bet too much and spread too much, out of ignorance and impatience.

My questions:

1.	How do you “deal” with fast dealers?  Is there a way to slow them down, or is it one of those situations where if you can’t keep up, you just find another table?
2.	If you lose count mid shoe, what do you do?  Leave?  Revert to the last known count?  Guess?  Flat bet?  Ask the dealer what the count was?  (That’s a joke).
3.	There were a couple times, embarrassingly, that I would have an RC of, say, 5.  I’d get distracted, and then when I continued counting I wouldn’t remember if it was 5 or -5.  I say “D” in my head for negative counts.  Down 1, down 2, etc..  is there a little trick you guys have in a busy game to remember if it’s plus or minus?  Or am I just an idiot?
4.	What bet spread do you use to avoid detection.  More specifically, when playing with a 400 unit bankroll, what would your spread be at a 6D, $10 Minimum table?
5.	When all the tables have bad pen do you sit and just play more tightly?
6.	Do you ever ask a dealer to adjust the pen in a playful way to see what happens?
7.	When is the right time to toke?  I usually would bet for the dealer rather than just give them money.  A couple times I got up and didn’t toke the dealer and kind of got a stare like I was an ass hole.
8.	In the situations I spoke about above, how would you camouflage yourself better than I did?  Keep in mind it was a dead casino and I was the only person at the table a number of times, the pit bosses knew who I was the moment I sat down.
9.	What side bets, if any, do you play?

Honestly, if you read this, thank you so much.  I’m excited to now be a student of blackjack and some of posts in this subreddit have really helped me!"

blackjack,How To Make A New Counting System For S21 Side Bet,"At my local card room, the Spanish 21 table has a side bet where you can bet on whether your opening hand will be under or over 13. Some math on another one of my posts shows that this bet is completely break even. However, it can be easily beaten with card counting. But since the normal Hi/Lo system is for the game of S21 and not Under/Over 13, I need something that helps with this bet specifically. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of using a system where the average value of an average card is always changing, where A-6 is +1 like usual, and 7-K is -1. This makes the sides of this even, meaning that there are 6 +1s in the deck, and 6 -1s in the deck. So by keeping a count, you should know how skewed towards one side of the spectrum it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I am not experienced in developing card counting systems, so I would like some advice on what I should use when going into the cardroom and pressing this potential advantage."

blackjack,Useful Profit-Estimation Tool that People Could Use,"Hey everyone, been learning blackjack over the past few months, but I wasn't a huge fan of how limited the amount of information there was in regards of how much one could potentially make from playing blackjack, so, I ended up designing my own tool using Excel that could also tell you what your expected risk of ruin would be:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mu07JpjjvhBXVrHoCol1PKuOXc1sR6eWS7cEfRr58ak/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mu07JpjjvhBXVrHoCol1PKuOXc1sR6eWS7cEfRr58ak/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

The Excel sheet is separated up into 3 categories, one being based on an 8 deck game (that assumes the true count frequency is the same as a 6 deck game), a 6 deck game, and a 2 deck game. The values that are highlighted in green are editable values that you can enter your own variables into in order to give you a more accurate representation of what your expected return will be.

&amp;#x200B;

I used data from the website listed on the sheet in order to determine the frequency of true count values, and went from there in order to determine the rest of the values. Risk of Ruin values were calculated using wizardofodds table, ~~but only includes up to 200 hands, since I don't expect most people to go above that in one playing session. I could potentially add in higher hand values if it's requested.~~

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions or suggestions on it, feel free to ask!

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** Updated the sheet now to show the risk of ruin if one is playing up to 400 hands in one sitting for convenience sake. In an ideal situation, this would be at minimum 2ish hours if you happened to be a table without any other players, but wanted to include it in case someone is putting in the long haul.

&amp;#x200B;

**2nd EDIT:** Added a section to indicate whether or not you will be ""Wonging"" during the game, and also added the rule set that is being used."
blackjack,Tips for a counter that has not been to the actual Casino yet?,"Hello all! I would like to start this post by mentioning that I do know a Hi Low count, and a Red Seven count. 

I also have studied (but maybe not yet totally memorized) basic strategy. I did not know what deviations where until 5 minutes ago, so I'll work on that.

My question for this sub is: How do you go about playing the game profitably and avoiding getting thrown out? Is your bet spread the most important factor to staying under the radar? How do I avoid the Pit Boss noticing my slowly growing pile of chips?

blackjack,Deck penetration when playing live online games,"I've recently started counting and am going through the usual practise drills, and I'm there or thereabouts as basic strategy. I've been using KO/REKO as an unbalanced count whilst starting out to avoid doing a TC conversion whilst I get better at everything.

Now, my question. Quite a lot of live online BJ here in the uk is using a shoe, not a CSM or a virtual random number generator etc. But as advised everywhere, the penetration is really bad like 50% and the game is pretty slow going. BUT, if you're using an unbalanced count, then should you be worried about penetration? For example, if the RC using KO/REKO goes high where you should start multiplying your stakes, but you're only say 5 hands into a 6deck shoe, then the high cards 'could' be anywhere in the 5.5 decks remaining, so why does it matter where the cut off is? With KO it says you raise your bets there and then regardless, but with a balanced count like HiLo, then you have to take into account decks remaining to get your TC, not so with KO or an unbalanced count.

So, should you be worried about rubbish penetration on an online game if using an unbalanced count?

blackjack,Is it bad etiquette to only play some hands at a blackjack table and sit out others?,"One of my friends and I just go to the casino to have fun, not to make money. I’m pretty good (but not perfect) with basic strategy, and he basically knows the obvious stuff like not to hit a 20, so I help him play. We bought in at a $10 minimum table for $100 each. I got pretty lucky and got a couple blackjacks, but he wasn’t having the same luck. He didn’t want to be out of money in the first 10 minutes, so he let me play a few hands and just watched me play for a bit. 

A few hands went buy and he put his money up to play a hand, and him playing that time caused him to “take a perfect match” away from another guy at the table, which he started whining about ofc. I debated saying something and telling him it could’ve easily gone the other way or whatever but I didn’t feel like getting into it with him. 

Is this just a ploppy complaining, or is this actually frowned upon at a blackjack table? Would you get mad if someone at your table played some hands and sat out others? We both just enjoy playing blackjack, but we’re college kids with a limited amount to gamble so we don’t want to spend it too fast. Thanks in advance for your responses."
blackjack,does anybody have a list of every single combination of cards?,"alright, so im thinking in calculating the porbabilty of blackjack, you just need to figure out what the likelihood of every single unique combination. i figure the maximum number is 30, if for some reason you hit on a 20 and get a ten. I know it would never happen, but i wanna have all my bases covered. maybe if the deck is really rich in aces its worth it. what i want to know is there's a list anywhere of every single combination. like

2 2 3

3 2 2

4 3 2

4 5 1 3

i know thered probably be a lot, maybe a few hundred or so, but if anyone knows for sure it would be greatly appreicated. thanks."
blackjack,Is this is a viable way to make money?,"Never really been into Blackjack, I only play poker. I went with my friend to play some cards and he played some BJ while we were waiting for the list to go down. 

After watching for a while at a $15 min table, people made all sorts of bad decisions. I even saw someone pay for someone else's double because they didn't want to do it.

Now that I've reviewed the basic strategy charts, I can see that people do not double or split nearly as much as they should (at least from my one time there). Is it viable to just watch people play Blackjack and then step in and pay for their doubles/splits when they wouldn't normally do it?

Has anyone done this? Do casinos allow it? Are players usually ok with it? Am I just an idiot?

Thank you!"

blackjack,How to calculate bank roll for basic strategy,"So this may be a weird question.  About 20 years ago I dealt out a ton of blackjack hands to look for a way to take advantage of streaks.  The result was that about 49.5 percent were streaks of 1s (so winner player winner dealer) then around 49. something of 49.5ish (so about 24.25?) were streaks of 2s (player win player win or dealer win dealer win) then 49.5 ish percent of 24.25 (so like 12.125%) were streaks of 3 and, then streaks of 4s etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this is some sort of binomial distribution or standard deviation, Boolean logic or other mathematical idea I don't get.  Essentially, what is the standard deviation of bankroll where 96% (or whatever the percentage is) of the range of losers to winners with not break.  I.e. at $5 bets I would guess making or losing more that $250 is an improbability.  Thus if you are changing your bets to say $50, you need a bank roll of $2500, just to maintain a normal investment that can handle the flow of the natural ups and downs.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is ""how do you calculate the exact deviations to know how much you can expect to lose/win at 50/50 odds?""  and do you set the max loss (i.e. you know the odds are in your favor, but you lost too much for the investment and your stop loss also protects you from unknowns you can't see, like being cheated etc, or if you get too tired to think, but don't know you are).

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: It just occurred to me that if I add them all up like 49.5+24.25+12.125+6.05+3.025 i would get around 96% which would give me 15 hands, 21 hands for 97.5 percent and 28 hands for 98.25 approx.  so 15\*5 is $75 streak minus house edge minus 4%? 28 hand streak for $140 minus house edge minus 1.75%.   Does this sound right?  I can't tell if my math is on because I have no idea how to check it.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know if any of this makes sense to anyone."
blackjack,Betting Deviations: How to Do Them?,"I've still got a few years before I ever get let in a Casino. But, this gives me a long time to practice still, and keep learning to perfect my game.

I have basic strategy perfect. Sometimes I have to slow down to make correct decisions, but I always end up making the correct choice. I'll keep practicing this, obviously.

I can do the True Count conversion fast (math has always been my thing), and I keep good (but not perfect) track of the running count. I have days where I'm dead on, and others where I get off my 2 or 3. This is probably the hardest part of my game, and I'll keep working on it.

I have the core deviations for a Stand S17 table, and the changes on the 18 for a Hit S17 table.

What I don't understand is Bet Spread. Obviously you bet more when the count is high, because there is more cards in the shoe to advantage you. But, how do I know how much to bet? How do I know if I'm underbetting? Overbetting? What's your thoughts?"

blackjack,Unique Surrender Rules and their impact on basic strategy,"I’m new to blackjack and just learning basic strategy, hovering at 90%, and so expecting to lose money for quite a while longer.

I’m learning basic strategy with surrender first, since that option is offered at the tables I play at. The thing is, while surrender is an option, I’m not sure if the surrender rules are unique, and if they are unique, how they would effect basic strategy. 

Here is how their website describes it:

‘You can surrender on any original two card hand, with the exception of when the Dealer has and Ace or a 10 value card, you may surrender if the Dealer does not have a Blackjack. When you surrender you receive half of your original wager back.’

So I played tonight. It’s a 6 deck table. And I guess it is early surrender (???) because the dealer deals out two cards to each player, then 1 card face up to himself, then players play their hands, then finally at the end the dealer deals himself his second card, then third, etc.

And one hand I had a J,5 and the dealer showed an A. My original bet was $5 (again I’m a noob), and so I surrendered. Thus, i didn’t receive any more cards, and a surrender chip got placed on my hand. The other players played, then the dealer got their second card, which was a Q, so blackjack. Thus, according to the casino rules my surrender got nullified by dealer blackjack, and I lost my full $5 bet. 

So a couple questions. 

1. Are these standard surrender rules? 

2. If not, what would basic strategy be for these surrender rules? 

3. What is the house edge in a BJ game that has these surrender rules, with 6 decks, with dealer hits on soft 17, with 3/2 blackjack payout, with infinite splits except only once on Aces, and with double after split allowed? 

Sorry if this is a noob question. But I thought surrender meant you always got 50% of your bet back? That ‘dealer blackjack nullifies player surrender rule’ isn’t anything I could find on google, so I thought I would ask here."

Now, I understand that this bet is definitely favoring the house, but there are a couple rules that I think  you may be able to use to exploit this. 

First, if you're counting, you should know what the average value of each card in the deck is. 

Second, you can join the game at any point. So you could come I  halfway through a shoe if you want. You can count, wait for your spot, then join. 

And lastly, you can make all other players side bets if they dont want to. So with 6 spots, if the count is high, you could put your money down on all 6 spots if you want. 

For there, dealer hits on a soft 17, and you can double twice, split up to 4 times.

Dealer rolls for player until the player has something over 15.

Dealer then asks whether to hit or to stay.

Player chooses which, trying to get close to 21.

Dealer then does the same, and aims to beat the player. Dealer does not necessarily stay on 17/18.

blackjack,Blackjack stories,"In light of all the posts about angry dealers, silly plopies, evil casinos and unfriendly stubborn gamblers, I'd love to see some happy stories and experiences of playing blackjack. Here's one, that happened to me the other week, to start.

I was playing at a casino during a slow hour. They only had three shoe tables open. I just got up from one, which went very negative. The second one was about two decks in and the third one just shuffled, but the table was full. For the lack of better things to do, I decided to count the new deck in hopes of someone leaving.

First round dealer gets a 20 and the running count is 4. Second hand dealer gets another 20, but the running count rising to 7 from the small cards players were dealt (I'm wishing there was one open spot). Tensions at the table are rising. Third hand, dealer showing 6, bunch of splits, doubles, running count is 8 after players make their hands and.. the dealer makes a 6-card 21 (with no As).

The table is fuming. Profanities shouted at the dealer, table gets banged with fists, hands thrown in the air. Five out of 6 people playing collar up and leave.

Running count 14. I quietly sit at the table after everyone, but a quite Asian lady in the corner of the table, is gone.

Me: rough table huh

Dealer: yeah...

Me: I'll play these three spots

The table must've been thought to be cursed that shoe; not one other person jumped in to eat my high count until the next shoe (and it stayed high the entire way through). I got a table with a count to live for almost entirely to myself"

But now im starting to pick up steam and am back to a $300 bank. I stop betting the min and just roll with $25 almost never letting it ride. The big break came when i split a pair of 8s on maybe a 10 i think. That hand split 4 times with two double downs and the dealer busts. I walk out of the casino up $500 and ecstatic. I cant play this again for a while but maybe ill train and learn to count."
blackjack,Aggressive Ploppy and Dealer,"Man, I had my least favorite interaction last night.

I saw a $10 table with just one guy starting a new shoe. The guy maybe had $75 in reds. I asked if he minded if I joined for the next shoe. Now I know going into this that lots of ploppies don't like people ""mixing up the cards"" and normally I will play most hands  even when the count goes slightly negative in the running count but never over a True -1.

Well this wasn't one of those times. It quickly went to a running -15 on a 8 deck shoe. I was lucky enough to catch a couple blackjacks and was up $70. I pulled my chips from the table and tell the dealer to skip me. The guy to my left immediately slaps the table hard and says ""Really?!!"" The dealer says ""You Serious?! You're winning!"" I tried to casually act as if I was playing streaks saying ""Yea! So it can't stay that way right?"" Other guy takes of his chips and flings his arms in the air then just stares at me. The dealer slaps the shoe forward on the table in the 'not dealing' position and aggressively says ""Well now HE'S out TOO!""

Me: ""color me up""

I know this is really just a venting post, but man do I really get frustrated by people that are clearly just gamblers acting like they know so much about a game that they clearly don't have a clue about and choosing to try to intimidate other people. Especially a dealer."
blackjack,S18 vs 10,I’ve been playing seriously for several years now and I have never once seen another patron play this hand correctly. Not once! It must be less than 1% of people know what to do in this situation and those that do know it are too afraid to hit. It’s baffling to me

blackjack,Question About Insurance,"I had some free time recently to start learning some basic strategy and practice counting in blackjack (currently developing a small simple program to serve as a card counting trainer), and had a question about insurance...

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's common wisdom from basic strategy that you **never** play insurance, but I ended up making some fair bit of change on it and was curious...in the completely fringe scenarios where there's very few cards left in the shoe, and the count is high, is it worth putting money down on the insurance? Or is it the better choice to stick to never putting money on the insurance?

&amp;#x200B;

I only ask because there was one instance in a casino where on my 2nd hand at the table if I had played the insurance I would've walked away with $6,000 and understandably this has haunted me a bit."

blackjack,This is stupid but I have to ask,"Hi guys,

I've been playing blackjack for a few years now but only for fun and to socialize, average of 1 trip/month to Fallsview casino in Niagara Falls. I just follow the basic strategy and that's pretty much it. 

So I recently found out about the Hi-Lo method and am in the process of learning it but keep on running into a mental roadblock, hopefully you can help. 

For some reason, I always associate high cards with +1 and low cards with -1. I believe it's probably due to the mental fort in my head and all the high cards end up going to the +1 room. 

If I count them slow, then I can pull it off but I'd like to get faster. 

I was wondering if I switch up the values (from +1 to -1), and still follow the same logic (and just reversing the - and + at the end to get RC and TC, would that cause any problems?

As of now, since I'm just getting started, what I normally do is pull our a deck of cards and do the count on my room, usually takes about 1 minute. 

Having said all that, do you guys have any tips or tricks on how to associate the cards with +1 and -1 counts?

Thanks in advance, I've got a lot to learn and practice, gonna be a fun journey, nice to meet you all."

blackjack,Rat-holing chips,"Hey guys,

I wanted to ask for advice, tips or just thoughts out loud of advantage players.

Rat-holing chips - is it worth it? Mostly when applied to rated play. Say I have a local casino with good rules, good pen, decent comps. I play multi hand red/green chips only (never blacks), socialize with regulars and dealers for cover. I seem to fly under the radar, but what if, one day, someone pulls my win/loss ratio and goes HEY! How is this guy in the positive after playing for nnn hours here?

Would it be worth it to casually palm a green chip every shoe or so? Could it possibly even impact the comps I'm getting on my card? I know casinos dislike it - would getting seen draw a lot of attention?

Also, do you guys have any clever tips or tricks to make rat-holing less noticeable and more casual?

The term, I'm sure casinos came up with it because it sounds degrading. Something like ""chipmunking"" would be more clever. Because CHIPmunks hide the nuts in their cheeks. Anyway..,"

blackjack,How much would you theoretically win/lose playing basic strategy with a laddering bankroll/bets of the house money,"My coworker who was a professional poker player and had a blackjack card counting team told me, to use this premise to get a bankroll started. Basically his concept is to go once a month with $300 playing 2 hands of $50 every time you win you increase your bet size in this manner playing 2 hands you bets look like this 50/50-75/75 125/125 200/200 ect.... until you flip it to $800-1k if you win you now have a $1000 bankroll which you play with in the same manner each day you go back you continue to play the exact same way with house money until you get to 5k, now placing $100 bets, and so fourth until you get anywhere from 10k to 50k and never touch the table again unless it’s for low stakes fun a few times a year. Or use this bankroll for counting. if  at any point you blow through your bankroll you start over again at  $300, and if you lose that you don’t go back for a month then try to start all over again next month."

blackjack,Reckless play style,"Let me just say that I'm new to blackjack and this is the story of my cousin.

I just recently got into blackjack and am still fluently attempting to learn basic strategy. My cousin started to take blackjack more seriously in the past few months and has taught me some things and even given me caution about others. I went to the casino for the very first time with him the other day when it was dead so it was just him and the dealer with me just watching. I observed him play and came away with the conclusion that his playing style is highly aggressive and reckless. For example about 60-70% he is hitting on 12+ counts against a below 7 upcard. He also sometimes will double down on 10s on upcards above 6, like on aces and face cards. His betting also seems to have no rhyme or reason. He will randomly double his bet a few turns in a row then go back to conservative betting. He especially starts betting a bit high if he gets near broke and then somehow comes roaring back. He played most of the game that I saw in the negative until the very end. At the end of the night he doubled his money. This all happened within the span of 40 minutes and it was a fucking rollercoaster of emotions that I have never felt lol.

How viable is his strategy? I asked him if he counts cards and he says no but he knows basic strategy but routinely has a gut feeling about specific cards. He says he knows that all he wants to do is double his money and cash out. 

I don't know what to make of it"

blackjack,2 basic questions for Blackjack,"Hey, sorry to bother again with beginner questions.

1. When I read rules to Insurance, it seems to be only offered if the upcard is an ace. Is this really the case or also if the up card is value 10?

2. If the table says 'Dealer must stand on 17 and must draw to 16' can I conclude from that information alone if it is a h17 game or a s17 game?"
blackjack,Basic Blackjack questions from a beginner,"Hey, I don't know much about Blackjack but learnt basic strategy anyway without ever having played a game of it. Now I look at the rules and have some basic questions, probably dumb ones.


1. I read that in Europe(I am in Europe) the dealer usually doesn't have a hole card, meaning he can't check for a possible blackjack. In my basic strategy chart it says that I always want to double down on my 11. Does that also count when the dealer has a possible blackjack? 

Which leads to my 2. Question: On the sites I read up on it seems to say that the dealer only checks for a possible blackjack if he has an ace as his first card. Doesn't he check for the hole card if it's a 10?


3. I read about h17 and s17 games of blackjack. It says that the dealer either hits or stands on a 'soft' 17. If the dealer has a 9 and a 7 and then gets an ace, leading him to a hard 17, does he stand or hit at that point?

4. Does insurance work the same when there isn't a hole card?

As I said, not very smart questions, but I'm having trouble finding this information and would be thankful for answers from you."

blackjack,Does Basic Strategy change depending on how many decks are in play?,
blackjack,Why is it more beneficial to stand on 12 depending on the dealer's upcard?,"I want to start off by saying I understand what basic strategy is. I follow it everytime I play Blackjack. I'm aware that the dealer is more likely to bust with a five or six, rather than a two or three upcard. If you're dealt a stiff 12 versus a five, the book says to stand. Conversely, if dealt a 12 versus a 2, the book says to hit. Other than the percentage chance of the dealer busting with a worse upcard, I've not understood why. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hitting a 12 gives you only a 30% chance to bust your hand. 10, Jack, Queen King. 4/13 cards is 30%. By this factoid alone, it's always in your odds to make a better hand by hitting a twelve. By standing on it, you're playing a passive game. You're hoping to win by the dealer busting instead of taking a shot with a 70% chance to improve your hand. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone explain why, aside from the increased chance for the dealer to bust, that it's beneficial to the player to make a decision that is more in the casino's favor?"

I was playing a childhood game of mine but on a private server an RSPS.. and it had a dice rolling npc and the odds were horrible..

The advantage for a break even \[50% chance to double 50% chance to lose \] I was working against was 10%.... and that might not sound massive but when you play enough games that you have a 40% chance to win and double and a 60% chance to lose your whole bet... It will feel massive even if after a large\[r\] sample size you are in the green by a significant amount 

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately what I'm wondering is if you are playing against a 2% house edge at what sample size will most players be screwed at in terms of being in the green --- let alone significantly positive / in the green.... and how doable is making significant profit against a 2% house edge \[ obviously you wouldn't keep playing because it's basically inevitable to lose it all even on a game you have a 50% chance to win and double it or 50% chance to lose your bet the longer you keep playing 

&amp;#x200B;

Also  I noticed something similar would happen when I played this one slot + card guessing app called titan slots.. I think

&amp;#x200B;

I even looked up cheats for it cause I was curious but then I noticed the video on cheating for it was a joke.. I was genuinely ridiculously ahead of the videos I saw even though I didn't and couldn't cheat on it

&amp;#x200B;

and the way titan slots works is you bet like most slots.. I think you can increase lines or it's automatically all lines but different bets and once you spin IF you win you can keep your win or you can choose to gamble your win but the way it's designed is unless you got really lucky with your spins you have to gamble your win on the spin or you will easily fall to 0 because of the cost of spins... but the thing is if you played the card game well you could potentially get decent profit or even massive profit... And I was playing it and very often gambling it... instead of red black which I wasn't doing too hot in I thought ""I bet I could win a lot more if I did the suit guessing "" and at the time I LOGICALLY knew that red or black is way better odds and that when you pick it can repeat so instead of 1/4 chance becoming 1/3 next one it remained 1/4 Also the max you could play even if you won it all was 5 I think... so 1/(4\^5) = 4,16,64,256,1024X your original win 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways I ended up doing that and It was like I felt like I knew somehow... even though I couldn't rationally explain it and I would gamble often and usually win all the way to the 4th or 5th.. and keep my winnings most of the time.. I ended up making uber profit... if that was a real game and I had similar results.. I would have bankrupted the casino or severely costed them profit 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know the actual math of my winnings but I know for certain the odds of it happening were enough to easily say it wasn't coincidence and the house edge was way worse than 2% or 10% because I was only gambling on suits \[ 1 / 4 \] \[ 25% \] to quadruple it  multiple times in a row for multiple bets and I didn't use the free gem to give you another chance \[ doesn't let you keep what you lost but let's you bet black or red or suits again and if you win you can keep the amount u win but if u lose.. you've lost all of it and the gem \] I also didn't pay for anything on the app.. and ended up with uber amounts of legit game money and gems \[premium currency that can also be earned for free \] 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite this I don't really believe in luck but I also don't believe in coincidence 

&amp;#x200B;

But my main question is: What real casino game with favor house edges can be ""Beatable"" and for how long and doing what?

&amp;#x200B;

IS blackjack the only game? is card counting and perfect basic strategy essential or can you deviate a little bit? what house edge is insurmountable that you shouldn't even play it super short-term"
blackjack,Dealer not taking 2 cards to start,At my local casino the dealer never takes 2 cards to start waits for everyone’s play to be done then hits for the second and so on.

blackjack,Basic Strategy Question - Double Down After Splitting?,"Hey everyone; I've been a huge craps player since I first set foot in a casino, but since getting engaged I'm ready to learn blackjack with hopes I'll lose less money at the casino and maybe get strong enough to turn the edge into my favor.  Over the last month or so I've been slowly memorizing blackjack's basic strategy with the intent of then how to establish a running count, then the true count.

I have a quick question regarding double down after splitting..  The basic strategy I'm currently memorizing is telling me to only split the following pairs if a double down is permitted after splitting:

- My 6s vs Casino's ""2""
- My 4s vs Casino's ""5"" and ""6""
- My 3s vs Casino's ""2"" and ""3""
- My 2s vs Casino's ""2"" and ""3""

Apologies if this is a stupid question, but using perfect basic strategy, does this mean I should ALWAYS double down after splitting the pairs listed above REGARDLESS of what my follow on cards are?

For example... lets say I'm dealt two 3s and the dealer is showing a ""2"", so I split them..  I'm then dealt a face card for each 3 giving me two 13s..  My instinct is telling me to then stand, because I was taught to always stand with a hard 13 against a dealer ""2""..  but this seems in conflict with the Double After Split rules for the combinations I listed above...  

What am I missing?  How exactly does the ""Split Only if Double After Split"" is offered work IAW basic strategy?  thanks!

1. I am using the BJ AIO Trainer for android but I also use PC at home and was curios if there were any other trainers out there for the PC/web I can take advantage of. I'd like to hear what everyone else is also using to keep skills sharp such as training the illustrious 18?

2. Follow up question, http://www.blackjack-drills.com/it/ has a nice Illustrious 18 trainer for web but the rules are off from the H17DAS chart I am using in the AIO app. It's supposed to be customizable but the signup/login is broken. Any alternatives or fixes?

3. is the blackjackapprenticeship.com worth the money? What are things I need to study if I were to skip this route?

3. Are there any good active bj or related online discussion or resources to help me learn that are recommended?

4. How will I know my errors while playing at the casino?

5. How often can I expect to get back off before I can have a chance to even break even? I feel like the Casino is going to be on to me quickly and just back me off while I'm down due to variance completely eliminating any advantage.

5. Is there a place where subscribers here play against each other?

I also want to say that on my journey to learn 21 I can now confirm that casinonewsdaily is a BS propaganda site that cost me quite a bit of confusion and time. The last few rules (""or fewer"" wording) in this article https://www.casinonewsdaily.com/blackjack-guide/illustrious-18 are completely backwards and I can only imagine why.

blackjack,Video Blackjack Poker Games (With virtual lady dealers),"Hey Redditors, first post here.

Curious to know if there is any official explanation to how the decks work in these machines?

I've been told by one of the casino employees (At Woodbine Casino, Toronto, Ontario) that all players (dealer included) pull from their own deck if they ante up, so technically, it could be 2 to 6 decks playing at once.

I've seen a dealer draw 4 aces before on the draw while other players had aces on the table. I feel like the algorithm could be rigged depending on the bet.

If anyone has a website handy, I would appreciate it. "
blackjack,Can any counters suggest to me what my expected hourly is in this game?,"My local casino just started offering shoe blackjack. 6 deck shoe, penetration is amazing looks to my naked eye like between 5 and 5.5 decks get played per shoe. Shuffle is done by hand after every shoe and takes about 3-4 minutes, I’d guess I get 200 hands an hour heads up but I confess I really have no idea. S17, RSA, DAS, no surrender, no dealer hole card, doubles/splits are lost if the dealer gets blackjack. Even money is offered but not insurance. If I rock up on a weekday night, I would very much expect to get the table either heads-up or with one other player.

I use Hi-Lo and keep the running count perfectly and can eyeball discards with reasonable accuracy to work out a TC. I know that even money becomes +EV at a TC of 3 or higher, and I know the indices for hitting 12 vs 2/3/4/5/6 and 16 vs 10 but haven’t memorised the rest of the Illustrious 18. (Some of them don’t even seem to apply to blackjack with no hole card? I haven’t been doubling 11 vs A for example at any count if I lose the lot to a BJ that just seems suicidal) But yeah, that’s where I’m at in terms of counting skill. 

In terms of bankroll management. The minbet was 10 the first time I saw this game and 5 last night so I’m not sure which one it’s more likely to be on any given night. My bankroll is at 7500 right now. My inclination is to use a max bet of 100 on TC’s of 6 or higher no matter what min they’re using but I would appreciate advice on this. Given this rule set and the amount of money I have, how much do you think I can make an hour?

blackjack,Poker player learning to play blackjack for fun/comps. Need advice!,"Hey everyone! 

Poker player here! I play 25NL online and $1/$2 live. I have a decent wjnrate and am a winning player. So why would I want to put effort into learning blackjack? For comps (main reason) and to increase EV of course.

When I play poker at the casino I’m rarely comped because that’s all I play. No slots or pit games. I’ve spent money learning to play poker. But once again (sigh) I get no COMPS.

Also, I’m going to Vegas in 2 weeks with my girlfriend, so learning basic strategy would be nice as I won’t be playing poker much (she doesn’t know how and she likes BJ too)

I just have a few questions:
1. How long did it take you to learn basic strategy and then card counting?
2. Any poker players out there who play blackjack on the side?
3. I’ve purchased the Knockout Blackjack book. Any other material that I should use? I have a couple phone apps I have downloaded to correct basic strategy errors too!"
blackjack,Never look a gift horse in the mouth!,"Bit of a seasoned gambler/BJ player here, usually online though, but in the last 2 years I've been going to a local Genting casino here in the UK,and I've not gone there for 6-7months (as I was spending and losing too much!) , so they sent me a email last week saying ""have we broke up?"" in regards to me not going in recent times  and here is 6000 points for you to use either at the restraunt or you can convert the points to use on our slots or even the table.

Thought it was too good to be true, but last night I went to the casino, cashed in 5000 points (which equates to £50) and headed to the BJ table.
First hand I bet £10 and lost, thought to myself ""here we go, I'm going to lose it all"" but somehow I went on a incredible run of wins, turned the remaining £40 into £150 in the end.

Not too sure what other UK  casinos or casinos around the world do to entice a member to come back and play, but for me turning £50 of what was free cash into £150  actual cash is one of the best offers I've accepted, the best thing about it all was that I did not even use any of my own money.

blackjack,$5 dollar blackjack in Biloxi?,I'm heading to Biloxi in a few weeks.  Are there any casinos with $5 blackjack/ craps tables?  
blackjack,I hate this game so much,"The closest casino to me is an hour away. I went a couple weeks ago with my boyfriend and bought in for $200. Using basic strategy on a $15 min table we each won $500 in a couple hours. Felt great! 

Went again last night and there were zero $15 tables in sight except one table paying 6/5. Damn. There were plenty last time paying 3/2 $15 min. The best table we could find was $25 min and against my better judgment, because I knew neither of us had the bankroll, we sat down. The pit boss came over and asked us where we were from and if we had players cards and kept trying to make small talk to us after the dealer dealt the first hand. I was kinda annoyed because it was very distracting. We each lost $200 in minutes. 

Got up, went to the bar to collect ourselves, found another table, still $25 min wtf, but it seemed to have a good vibe and the dealer was starting a new shoe. Cool. Sat down and lost $300 more. The dealer could. not. lose. I know that’s the game but damn it hurt to see the dealer turn 16s and 15s effortlessly into 21s.  Or get blackjack 5 times out of 10. 

I watched as the whole table was getting killed. We went through 2 shoes of 8 decks before we left and the dealer kept getting face cards or aces. Almost every single time. It felt rigged but I guess that’s just the game right?

How do we turn this around? 

I’ve read books, and we practice at home. It just seemed like this time it was unbeatable. I need to learn to count obviously but this last trip made me want to just give up all together. 

Obligatory sorry for the format I’m on mobile, and for rambling. My anxiety is high from the loss! 




"
blackjack,New to blackjack and gambling. Have a very basic question.,"So as I am slowly trying to learn, as far as card counting goes, a positive count means there are more high cards 10’s, face cards, and Aces) remaining in the deck. The low cards (2’s to 6’s) have been drawn out and played.

This works to the player’s advantage because of the increased chances of being dealt a Blackjack, and high cards bring your hand closer to 21. And the dealer has a better chance of busting their hand (I believe that’s correct?)

But wouldn’t these same high cards also allow for the dealer to draw to a solid hand, just like the player? A hand between 18-21. 

I was hoping someone could Eli5 the basic probability or strategy for this? Why it would benefit the player more than the dealer?"

2. Dealer does not have blackjack, so player is paid 3 to 2 on original bet.

My question is, what if the player has blackjack showing, and the dealer has a 10 or face card showing? Can the dealer offer even money (they dont offer insurance)? If not, do you get paid 3 to 2 before dealer checks for Ace or is it possible to push in this situation? "

While waiting in the long lines, I would kill time at a $5 table, playing rated. Then started counting cards, and over the span of the last 3 months, took their $25 table for about 2500 in 17 hours spread across 3 sessions. Today it ended with a backoff that resulted in a pit boss and 3 security guards intimidating me into handing over my players card.

  
I stupidly did, and so now they have my name and ID. The security guards also took pictures of me and a video of varying angles of my face while I was talking to the pit boss. He just told me my play is too strong, I'm not welcome on the BJ tables, but I can play anything else if I so choose. It's safe to say I'll never be playing there again, but my question is that now that they have my ID, am I fucked for all nearby casinos? Do they all communicate?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I know playing rated and basically handing over my ID is the stupidest thing I could have done, but this is my first ever back off and I was admittedly rattled. I know I was a fucking dumbass. But, am I fucked beyond repair? If I go back there and play unrated do I risk arrest? Any experience with back-offs is welcome. Thanks."
blackjack,ENHC deviations for Hi-Lo,"Hello, I really need some help and am having a hard time finding information.

I would like to know what deviations to play on ENHC games. (We're usually talking about S17, DAS, split up to 4 including aces etc, say 4.5/6 pen)

Please do not send me the I18 or something the like, remember, I'm talking about european NO HOLE card, so the dealer does not check for blackjack. 

I think most deviations would be the same, but there is a very important thing that would probably differ,which is when you're up against an Ace.

In american blackjack if you're still playing against that Ace it means no BJ for the dealer, in ENHC you can't know. So what do you even do with a 16 vs A? I confess even for american blackjack I'm not sure.

Anyway, I would massively apreciate with help on this, finding information about ENHC is easy when you just wanna learn BS or something simple, but when you get into these more advanced concept it seems impossible. Maybe I just don't know where to look, if there's any good book or online community specifically for ENHC please do let me know.

It's just really frustrating wanting to get to the next level and seeing all of this in depth and advanced information out there and yet you're just not sure how well it actually aplies to what is played in your country of if you're completely just missing out or even doing big mistakes.

Thank you!"

blackjack,My Own Recent Experiences,"My wife and I began frequenting a casino towards the end of last year. I have been playing BJ and doing fairly well at it but since we are there pretty much every weekend now, we have come up with some ground rules to keep myself in check. I typically sit down with $200 at a $15/hand table. On average we have been walking out with $200+ in profits from each visit with only one recent loss because we decided to go back for a second time in one weekend (which basically took us to even for that weekend).

&amp;#x200B;

1. Always play with money we can afford to lose.
2. When that money is gone, we are done, no excuses.
3. If I am up $100 at the end of the shoe, color up the initial amount and set it aside.
4. If I am up $200 at the end of the shoe, walk away.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's not the most exciting way to play but I have successfully ground out a profit of about $1,500 since December. I am not any type of advanced player, no counting is done. I bet the minimum until I win a hand then increase to $25, play that until I lose and then drop back down. If I am feeling frisky I increase to $40 but only if I really feel like the dealer is falling apart. I rarely do any side betting. I pretty much only do it if I get BJ and get paid a $2.50 chip. "

blackjack,First time playing an unpleasant game of black jack,"New lurker here... wanted to see if anyone else has had a similar experience, or insight to the situation I had whilst playing blackjack.

I was at a casino playing blackjack and after hitting on a soft 18, when the dealer had a ten, the entire table started jumping down my throat about how I was messing the game up for them. One guy even said “you’re not playing for the table! You’re playing for yourself!” Basic strategy says to hit on a soft 18 in this situation but the other players were not having it. It got pretty heated to point where every new hand the table kept asking me if I was going to play right. Before this however I did split two 9’s when dealer had a seven, but this was a true mistake - I shouldn’t have done that. Out of pure luck I did win on those cards though.

On the soft 18 I ended up hitting a 21, and left shortly thereafter. I ended up leaving with $70 more than what I started out with. So I guess my question is, what are the opinions out there that blackjack is a team game? Or were these people just super cranky cause they were losing?

Edit: forgot to mention the dealer was on the other players side, and even told me I was “in denial” for not believing that my decisions can negatively impact the rest of the players."
blackjack,Split Tens Twice...on same hand,"Using hi-lo, true count was +16. 6 deck shoe. I didn't have my max bet out at the time because the person next to me was talking about card counting and the pit boss was right there. Ugh....I took a swig of my drink and made a smartass joke about it. 


I had 4 units out so I made a profit of 8 units after splitting 10s twice. While it felt awesome being able to track the cards, I was playing scared/using camouflage. There were two whales at the table and the staff kept talking to them. Like, gtfo and let me make some money please! I would have loved to put my max bet out and color up afterwards. 


Penetration was amazing, we played damn near the entire shoe with a few dealers. This hekped tremendously, because the table minimum was $10, and none of the $5 tables offered real blackjack at 3:2. "
blackjack,Request clarification on video documenting cheat,
blackjack,"First time playing BlackJack at the Casino, different rules?","Hi, first thread, although I've been reading this sub a lot, learned Basic Strategy and the Hi-Lo system.

So I decided to give it a shot yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

I found out that the local Casino has two kind of tables, one with a 3 and the other with a 7 bucks minimum bet.

Of course they use a Sabot in the latest, and the first one uses a CSM, I didn't carry too much money so I chose this one and played about an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked with the croupier a couple times between hands and got some info like:

\- I could only double with Hard 9, 10 or 11's. Never on Soft Hands. (Is this a common rule?)

\- Of course counting was not useful(I didn't speak about it, obviously, but noticed).

\- Basic Strategy kind of worked.

The interesting part was that they said that from their own experience it didn´t matter that much. Like the odds says if there were too much 10's on the table there wouldn't be another one if you hit once more, something like that.

I didn't trusted them that much, because I had the BS chart all over my head.

\- Maybe the most important part was they way they dealt cards, I never thought they would deal one per player, and one for them, until everyone on the table had 2 and the croupier 1, so you can keep hitting and then after all the players ended their play then the croupier gets his second card and keeps hitting until 17, I never expected that.(I think this changes everything for the player, since the croupier latest cards aren't decided until everyone ends their plays)

They said people in groups helps each other, and often the last player on the left keeps hitting so he and the dealer go over 21 sacrificing himself! WHAT WERE I LISTENING?!

\- Finally, they said sidebets were the way people played the most there, even betting more than the main bet. I don't learn that yet. I'd like to btw.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I noticed I lost and got money back really often during that time, but never earned more than I brought, in the end I lost. But I was satisfied and want to come back, and I'll really win next time."

blackjack,Pit-Boss had me give money back to the house 20 minutes after I sat down- this normal?,"Tonight I went to a pretty well known casino in the Northeast, that I routinely visit. I put down $100 like always for BlackJack and was having moderate success. After 20 minutes of being at the table, the pit boss said that after the reviewed the tapes the dealer gave me $125 instead of $100. She said I needed to give the $25 back or else security would come over. I didn't want to cause a scene so I obliged, and immediately colored up afterwards. I swear that I was given $100 at first, because I always bet the minimum (this table $10) on my first bet and then divide my chips into two even stacks. I would have noticed one stack was taller than the other, because I routinely make sure I have even stacks. Should I have asked to see the footage myself? I know it is only $25, but I can't help but feel like they took advantage of me.

Update: From advice given here, I called and let it be known I was upset. I was comped a meal in one of the VIP lounges for me and a guest, the next time I go."
blackjack,Blackjack (22 pushes),"I stumbled upon an interesting format. 

The Good:
The house will cover the costs when you split pairs and double down on 9, 10, 11 but will still pay out like you put up the cash. 

The Bad:
If the dealer pulls a 22 then the hand pushes and doesn’t bust (even if you have 21).

I only saw the dealer flip a 22 a couple times but I did see a lot of instances of players doubling and splitting. Not sure how the math changes (I’m confident the house still has the advantage) but it definitely looked fun! 

I would def love any pointers on how to handle."
blackjack,First Outing and did well with KISS until my buddy scared the crap out of me. Plus a few lessons learned for newbs.,"For a much anticipated trip to Vegas, I spent the last several months studying the game. I even bought a great book, an 8 deck shoe, an 8-deck stacker, 12 decks of cards, and casino chips. 

I read everyday and practiced every evening playing a minimum of 3 shoes with music blaring and a casino sound track playing very loud. All that was missing to create the environment was cigarette smoke. 

This was a group trip. One person found a $5 table and begged me to play. I was hesitant, knowing it would be 6:5, hit S17. I watched the table anyway until the shoe finished then jumped in. 

The players were friendly and encouraging and the dealers seemed somewhat new just because they weren’t very fast at dealing or math. What would I have to lose? Bedsides, I had two friends at the table as well. 

Nobody knew my secret...

New shoe of 6 decks. Started at 10. Played perfect BS and staying pretty much even. Not losing and not winning. Finding it relatively easy to keep count. Suddenly my count hits 21. I play another hand and now the count is 24. 

I doubled my bet. Wouldn’t you know, I get 8/3 so I double down and catch a 10. I’m thinking, “Damn! This works!” It didn’t occur to me that I had $20 on the line, All I knew was KISS worked and this shit might be real. 

A hand came upon my shoulder as well as the shoulder of my buddy next to me. An authoritative voice stated, “I’m gonna have to ask you gentlemen to step away from the table.”

My heart starts pounding. Oh shit! What’s happening?

I slowly turned my head to see my buddy just arrived and was playing a joke on me. We all had a good laugh, but I lost my count. I tried to pick it back up, but it wasn’t long and I was down $50. 

I stopped to regather myself. All in all this was a great practice experience and I feel I did well all things considered. I learned a few lessons as well:

1. Whatever advantage you use must be perfect. 

2. Practice everyday. 

3. Whatever advantage you use must be perfect. 

4. Make mistakes on $5 hit S17 to build confidence. 

5. Whatever advantage you use must be perfect. 

6. Practice everyday. 

Edit:
7.  Don’t play 6:5"

blackjack,Vegas/Henderson Stations,"Hi everyone,

Headed out to Vegas in a month or so, and I was wondering if I could get your advice on these casinos. Are there any station/local casinos that are relatively low heat with playable double deck games? And if I do end up getting backed off at any stations, what is the chance that I'll get flyer-ed for the rest of the trip! I've taken a look at the Wizard's blackjack survey, but I was more curious about how sweaty these places are and if there are any spots I can check out. For reference, I usually play $10 minimums with a 1-8 or 1-9 spread in DD, though I sometimes spread to 1-6 if I believe that will give me some more longevity.

Thanks for your advice! If you're more comfortable PM-ing this, I am perfectly happy with that too."
blackjack,Best way to get to profit in one night of playing?,"   So I plan on going to my local casino game with about 1k and doing my best to come out ahead in just in night of playing. I’m just wondering what my best course of action is. 
 

   I know nothing is guaranteed, and there is no sure way to come out ahead. But I just want to know if I should bet 25 a hand, Or bet 5 a hand and fluctuate my bet up to maybe 50 and 25 every now and then. 
  

    No I will not be counting, but would it make sense to notice a lot of low cards were taken out the last 4 or 5 hands or so then raise my bet? Or is that a ridiculous idea because I don’t know the true count.

blackjack,Questions about the house's edge and rules for the BlackJack table at my place,"Hi,

Newby here, don't roast me because I'm stupid or idiot please, this is literally why I'm here asking.

In the province of Quebec, all the gambling is dealt by a government company. This is a monopole and we can't do shit about it. They released on their site a live BlackJack table. Perfect for us, as we are all over the province and not only in Montreal.

**First question:** 8 decks, 50% penetration, no double after split, one double allowed on every cards, BJ pays 3:2, one split allowed only, split on Aces allowed, but one card on each. And... 7 players on the table simultaneously.

Because it is online, I set up an Excel spreadsheet to not have to worry about counting cards. I use hi-low II. Because of the low penetration, **the max I saw over 200 hands played is +4 and it will last 2-3 hands max.  Is it worth it?** how much in comparison of my initial bet do I have to place? 1:5, 1:10?

&amp;#x200B;

**2nd question:** This is something I'm suprised I haven't seen elsewhere. I though about it and didn't read it and want your opinion on that. I firmly believe that, **everything in life tends to go back to his average**. Stock markets, airplanes tickets, etc... and BlackJacks. Average on BJ being 46% of wins, **what do you think about betting a larger stacks when you are having a 10%-20% success rate** on the last X hands played?

&amp;#x200B;

**3rd question**: They have added sidebets on the table. 21+3 and perfect pairs --&gt; 21 +3  = normal rules with the smallest payout being 5:1 for a colors. Perfect pairs: 25:1 for same color. 12:1 for same visual color (black and black, or red and red no matter the colors on the card) and 5:1 for a mixed pairs. For this, I also think everything tends to go back to his average. Average being 5,8% for both (lowest payout) approximatively. This means 1 winning bet for each 20 bets on the sidebet. **I keep track of the results without betting on the sidebet**. When the last winning sidebet (for me) on the 21 +3 (for example) was **25 hands ago, I start betting for 5 hands (no more)** or less if I have the winning bet. If I lose 5 hands (only talking about the sidebet), I'll wait for the next time the same condition will be met, and will martingale on it. **What you think?**

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the english, it is not my natural language. I don't have problem reading or understanding, but writing and speaking is harder

&amp;#x200B;

Have a nice day!

blackjack,Help figuring out a winning bet spread?,"I have a $5000 bankroll and can usually play on $5 minimum - $100 maximum tables. If not that limit, then for sure $10 minimum - $100 maximum. Assuming perfect basic strategy &amp; illustrious 18 deviations and perfect counting, what should my bet spread be like and what is my risk of ruin. For the last few weeks of practicing live at casinos, I've been playing $5 anytime the true count is under 2 and wonging out when the true count is -1. I'm not worried at all about heat since no one has ever seemed to care, my only worry is keeping a low ROR for now, but I want to start to be more profitable. I've only been spreading at $10 +2, $15 +3, $20 +4, $25 +5 and $30 +6 or more while I learn. I'm also very curious to know when it is best to play more than one hand and what the bet spread should like like when doing so. I believe my game is ready to maximize my profits, but I'm hoping for advice or someone to run the numbers for me with both the $5 and $10 minimums and these conditions. 

Game is always 6D, H7, DA2, DAS, No Surrender, PEN of ~75%-80% now that I've watched most dealers and know which to play with after a shuffle. Please let me know if you need any more details about the game or anything. I appreciate it."

blackjack,I (23M) have pretty much given up on gambling after tonight,"I have been going to casinos since I turned 21 and have only really played blackjack and craps. I have been tracking my win/loss amounts in my notes on my phone and this Monday I was at -$400. Not a big deal but I wanted to try and fill the gap. 

I started out playing $10 hands with an $800 buy in. After about 6 hours I closed the gap and was actually up $1200. That’s where I should have stopped, but didn’t.

I returned the next night and, betting in the same way and playing by the book with some counting, ended up down $800 on the night. Still up $400 on the year.

That loss hurt a little so I decided to go back the night after and try my luck again. I lost $1600.
Down $1200 on the year.

In a LAST ditch effort, I went again tonight and, like clockwork, lost $800. 

I am now down $2000 and have made up my mind not to go to a casino again until I can afford to lose like this. I’m devastated but can only blame myself."

blackjack,How long can you stay hot in this game?,"I'm winning now over the last several days of multiple sessions, probably totalling I don't know 20 or 30 hours. Mostly I play two hands. I'm not a counter except for keeping track of Aces and I do notice when a ton of small cards have come out but I don't count them and I bet accordingly. Still, I am fairly certain I am a long term loser if I continue playing. That said, if I can run this further, I'd like to. I'd say with the speed of the dealers and the hands I play, I've easily played 6000 hands. Obviously a deck of cards doesn't know that I've won or lost, but as a poker player if you haven't hit three of a kind with pair after pair you do eventually become ""Due"" in a way, it will happen. In the reverse, if all your big pocket pairs are holding up your sets hold against flush draws etc, you can expect that pretty damn soon that's going to change. Maybe not the next session, but within a week at most. Should I retire or keep pressing things?"

blackjack,Everyone’s favorite topic: Martingale!,"Yes, it cleans you out over the long term. Yes, table limits eventually stop you from doubling. And yes, you eventually run out of cash.

But I’m talking about the 4-step Martingale which currently has me up + $9,400 on $25 bets over the course of 10 different visits to casinos. 

The odds of winning have to do with how you play and the rules of the game. Card counting increases your odds. 

Playing the 4-step Martingale system does not change the odds at all. What it DOES do is prolong your streak long enough to get out with a set stop limit.

For those of you who don’t know what Martingale is, it is the system of doubling your bet after each loss until you win. The 4-step Martingale means you do it 4 times, like this: 

1. Bet $25 (win $25, 52% chance you lose)

2. If you lose, bet another $25 (win $0, you’re even, or 26% chance you lose)

3. If you lose, bet $50 (win $0, you’re even, or 13% chance you lose)

4. If you lose, bet $100 (win $0, you’re even, or 6.5% chance you lose)

If you lose 4 straight, you have lost $200, reset back to $25 and start over. But there’s only a 6.5% chance of this happening.

Bonus: often times, during the process, you hit blackjack on the bigger bet. Yeah, it’s sweet when that happens! :-)

The key is to set a limit. $200 is good, that means 8 wins and you’re out. 

Playing the 4-step Martingale is like having the sword of Damocles hanging over your head. At any point you can hit that 4 loss streak, set yourself back $200 and need to make up even more ground. 

So I set the limit at $200 then walk and do something else fun before coming back. 

Anyone other than me try this with as much success? "
blackjack,Similar casino table games to blackjack?,"Hey guys,

I'm an avid sports bettor &amp; was a semi-pro poker player through my university days. Just started diving more into blackjack for the fun of it and I'm loving the depth of this seemingly simple game with the different card counting strategies, etc. 

My question is is there any similar games that are popular in offline and or online casinos (I have access to several of both types) that require some strategy and have some depth. I've looked at the most popular casino games like Baccarat, Craps, etc but find those pretty unappealing. Any suggestions are welcome!

blackjack,Typical Low-Limit Vegas Rules?,"Hi, all. I am going to Vegas soon and was curious what are the ""typical"" rules one would encounter at a low-limit blackjack game downtown or on the Strip. I know the basic strategy adjustments for different rules, but would like to practice on the set I am most likely to encounter. I'm guessing:

* Double after split allowed
* Double on any two cards
* Split up to four hands total
* No resplitting aces
* Late surrender?
* EDITED TO ADD: Dealer hits soft 17

6/5 I assume is common, but that doesn't change basic strategy, and I'm not likely to play 6/5 anyway.

Thanks."
blackjack,Interesting thought of strategy,"I haven’t run any calculations on this and it is more so a hunch.

I’m usually no less than a green chip player and I hover around 115-170 a hand average on a multiple day trip.

Have been playing blackjack for the last 6 years or so, so I have a good feel for the game BS but I don’t AP.

So I began to think after this weekend at Foxwoods where my buddy hit a 6/5 table with a 200 buy in for 5k.

We played mostly BS but also however the hell we wanted to with more so a lucky chance.

My idea is to only play hands 14 or less double (10,11) and split 8s and Aces only and you’re supposed to and stay on any 15 or 16 regardless of surrendering. Could be your call.

The 14 or less is regardless of what the dealer is showing whether it’s a face, 9, ACE.

The whole idea of basic strategy is to value the dealers hole card as a 10, but why is this?

There isn’t a greater chance it’s a 10 rather than a 2,3,4,5 ect.

I have more often than not have won more hands staying on 15-16s when the dealer was showing a face followed by a small hole card.

In any other situation we value that hole card as a 10 but why?

Could this work heads up you and the dealer where more or less you’re putting the pressure on the dealer to bust? 

Of course the variance of this game can kill anyone but my personal biggest hits of 4k plus have been when I’ve been drunk and playing losely, staying on 14s 16s ect.

Thoughts?

At the time, TC was about +15 (it was absurd). I was dealt 10,3 and dealer was showing an A. I had my max increment bet out (and also playing at the highest $ table I’m comfortable playing at). I made the decision to take the insurance, and the dealer had it. 

My question is, there’s always talk of “don’t insure a bad hand.” Is that just non-AP nonsense? My understanding is that, if the count is high enough, you should be insuring *any* hand, regardless of strength, given the high likelihood of a dealer blackjack. Is that correct?

2. In your mind when doing running count do you say positive one and negative one? I find that only stating when it’s negative is easier to remember. When I say to myself  1,2,3,etc I know it’s positive count leaving out the word positive in my mind.

The Online Casino I currently play at shuffles the cards about about 50% (running an 8 deck shoe). I understand that the closer you get to the final deck the more powerful card counting becomes.

blackjack,Ideas on scripting rainman-level card counting for bet/play optimization?,"I'm playing for virtual stakes in a game where I have some basic scripting capabilities, and I""d like to replicate the calculator found at [https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/hand-calculator/](https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/hand-calculator/) AND add betting strategy into the mix, but I can't find the math behind it. Since I know every card except for any dealer hole cards on a bust I can really get into ""there are X of each card left"" and since I'm able to script it out I think I should be able to do better than the basic card counting I'm familiar with. Any suggestions on finding the math behind a calculator like this?

&amp;#x200B;

FWIW my ruleset is:

Double on anything

No resplitting (Aces or otherwise)

No surrender

Dealer stays on soft 17

Blackjack pays 3:2

Five card charlie

You lose entire bet (not just original) on dealer blackjack

Insurance (is this ever worth it?) pays 2:1, can insure for half your original bet.

Six decks, cut card is at -roughly- the end of 5 decks worth of cards.

~~I believe dealer does NOT peek for blackjack, but I'm not 100% on that (have not yet played a hand where dealer had an Ace).~~

EDIT: Confirmed - dealer does not peek. Dealer does actually deal the hole card, though, so if we bust out it's basically like we've moved the cut card forward (since we burn the card without seeing it).

EDIT2: I'm not sure ""card counting"" is the right statement for this. I basically want to build the optimal blackjack playing robot - the math is clearly out there as I see plenty of calculators for best play in a hand, but I don't know the math behind the decision-making (I know basic strategy but the decisions differ of course sometimes given remaining cards in the deck). I have some rough ideas on how I could do the math, to an extent, but if someone had a link I'd MUCH rather not reinvent the wheel."

One gets a 7, stand. Other gets a 2, so naturally I double it. Now I know I'm just playing the book here but its still more money on the table than I would reasonably like to have lol. But its fine right he has a 6, lets make some money!!!

Dealer goes 6-5-10. Right out of the bad beat book. RIP. Fairly certain that is illegal to do to someone yet here we are

Luckily my count was accurate and I kept hammering with the good count, finished quite a bit in the green for the night. Had a great time with friends. I know BJ is a game played over time. But holy hell I almost threw up"

* 600.25 hours of play (doesn't include transit time)
* 138 sessions
* 7 venues
* net wins at 5 properties for the year, losses at 2
* net profit $6,461
* hourly rate $10.76

I didn't keep track of food and beverage comps throughout the year but I estimate those at roughly $2,000 in addition to cash earnings.  I'm going to update my spreadsheet for 2019 to keep better track of expenses/compensation such as food and gifts.  I do have pretty nice monthly comps built up at most of the properties now heading into 2019 for free play, cash back, etc."
blackjack,A Satire on Blackjack for Dealers and Veteran Players,
blackjack,Some old guy got angry at me but i didn’t know why while playing blackjack,I was playing peacefully in an electronic blackjack table (first time playing and i know the basics) and this random old guy was speaking to me everytime i lost my hand but i didn’t know why. I can’t understand most of what he said but i kinda heard something like “why would you hit if you got 13?” So i smiled because i didn’t even know what im doing and i just want to beat the dealer then he said to me that “it’s not funny.” 
blackjack,"I know my strategy is bad and I know people are against these strategies. However, it has worked for me so far and I want to understand why, in the long run, it will fail me.","Btw, my conclusions could be very wrong, but here is what I think.
The only edge dealer seems to have over the player is that, if they both bust, dealer still wins. Having said that, I almost never hit once I hit a hard 12. I always stay. (If the dealer has a face card up, I might hit based on gut feeling, but for the purpose of this post, let’s assume I always stand on 12 and 12+)


Another thing I do is the doubling strategy. I sit on 5$ tables with 650$. to lose with this strategy, I have to lose 7 hands straight. 

I feel like this is a good strategy, but I’ve heard people telling me it’s bad, but they don’t know why. "

blackjack,Was this just horrible luck or does it happen quite often than expected?,"This happened today at Mt.Airy Casino in PA. In one session (playing through the whole deck), the dealer went onto make a 21 four times. Let me give you all the scenarios that I vividly remember that happened:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Had a 9 and 2 against a dealer 4. I double, get a 9 for a 20. Dealer flips the face down card for a 7, and then pulls a K for a 21. LOSS.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Had two 10's for a 20 against a dealer 3. Was thinking I had this sealed. But nope. Dealer flips the face down card for a 10 and then a 8 for a 21. LOSS.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Had two's 8 against a dealer 2. I split. On the first 8, I pull a 3. Double down. 10 for a 21. On the second 8, I pull a 10 for an 18. Dealer flips the face down card for a 4, then a 10 for a 16, and then....guess what? That's right, a 5 for a 21!!! Unbelievable that this happened for the 3rd time in 1 session

&amp;#x200B;

4) Had an 18 against a dealer 8. Praying that his face card is a 10 so I can at least break even, he flips the face down card for a 3, and then guess what he pulls next....? That's right, a face card for a 21. Fourth this happens and that's when I was close to getting my bankroll wiped out.

&amp;#x200B;

Lost my entire starting $500, I feel like my soul got wiped out...entirely! Most likely never playing BJ again, it was very hard dealing with these nightmare scenarios. I understand they DO happen but it was hard to believe it happened 4 TIMES in one session. I have never left the casino so angry and soul-less than I did today. Unbelievable if you ask me."

blackjack,"After 18 years of successful play, I just want to congratulate someone......","I have played thousands of hours at hundreds of casinos, am on international “do not play lists” and have had pit bosses walk up to me multiple times in my life and call me by my first name within 20 minutes of sitting at a table without ever showing my ID in the area. Resorts in the middle of nowhere that have no idea I am in town.  I know how to play....and win.....and don’t even remotely care when I am asked to leave, which has conservatively happened to me at least 25 times in my life.  

With that in mind, I would just like to congratulate the Rivers Casino in Chicago. Zero heat on their tables. Yet they have become the first casino in all of the world that I have encountered who refuses to let me win. 10 trips there this year and 8 losses. Typically I am the inverse.....but not at Rivers. 

Bravo. Whatever you are doing, keep it up. However, if there is ever a grounded accusation of impropriety from another player concerning your card games, I will be second in line to call for an investigation.  I have no evidence to suspect there is, though. You win. I surrender. 

In the meantime, enjoy.  I will never return to your casino.  I never thought there would be an unbeatable casino, but “Uncle!  I give up.”  You win.

blackjack,Dealer Ignored My Hit Sign Twice...,"New to r/blackjack, and just got back from my first time playing blackjack in a casino (have played plenty of times on card nights with friends), so maybe I don’t understand all of the table etiquette...

Playing at a quiet table, just me and one other player.

First hand, I was dealt a 3/4 face up (obvious hit), but was watching the other player because I thought it was his turn. He hit, then stayed. As I went to signal the “hit” sign, the dealer was already flipping his hand, and proceeded to collect my chips since he obviously beat a 7. I thought maybe I was slow on the draw. My fault. Or maybe he should’ve checked in with me since in his eyes, I never even gave a “stay sign”. Whatever, I’ll adjust.

Second hand, I make sure to make eye contact with the dealer and assert myself. Hit. I’m over. Oh well.

Third hand, (mind you, I only played $30 on a $10 minimum so was down to my last bet). Get the hand. 4/7. Obvious Hit. AGAIN, I look at him and hit the table. I read an article saying to stick to the hand signals so your words are never misunderstood/unheard. And as if I never even did anything, the dealer proceeds to check his hand, win (obviously), and takes my chips. I was cleaned out and walked away. 

Could somebody explain to me the reasoning for this? Was I not giving clear signals? Is there a rule I’m missing when two or more people are on the table? (My prior table was just me and the dealer.) Any and all help is appreciated!"

blackjack,Is This Local Spanish 21 Game Beatable?,"Last night I went to play some poker because Wednesday is the high hand and that's when all of the fish come out to feed. After being up a bunch, I went to the Spanish 21 table to practice counting cards. Now, one of the dealers and I were talking about counting cards and he said that the owner doesn't really care what you do. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the game itself, your min bet is $5 and the max is $10. That alone isn't really beatable, but there are some things that make me want to look a little further into it. Firstly, there are spots that you can bet on whether the dealt cards are going to be higher or lower than 13. These also have a $10 betting limit (State rules I guess). So I got to thinking about it and if the S21 deck has no 10s in it, then the TC is -4. With 6 decks, the RC would be -24. With the TC being -4, the average value of an unknown card in the deck gets closer to 6. So wouldn't it be a really good bet to stick with the $10 less than 13 bet if the TC stays around -4? How profitable would this be?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, you are allowed to jump into a game whenever you want. You can hover and count cards if you want to, and jump in when the count is high. I was just watching last night, and the RC got to +7 with 3 decks left, so it can definitely get up there. 

&amp;#x200B;

There has got to be a way to exploit this. Dealer has to hit on a soft 17 and you can double at any time you want. You can even double twice. I really feel like this can be beaten, so if anyone has any idea on how, please let me know!"
blackjack,What happens in this situation?,"Say Im at 14 and the dealer has 15. The rules are he hits up to 16 and stands on 17. In a 1 on 1 situation does the dealer have to hit and risk busting?

blackjack,Is dealer pay adjusted to their “performance”? If so how?,"So I’ve heard that dealers get paid on an hourly rate. 

But at the same time, it sounds like the faster they deal, the better (not sure about this, but I thought so after reading from a post here that dealers don’t count cards because it “slows them down”). In that case, how is this “fastness” being measured? Do casinos keep counts of number of decks dealt? Or do they simply measure the money won by a dealer over time? This last possibility doesn’t seem likely to me, because I think dealers genuinely don’t care if they lose to players, if not happier (for the tips)

So do casinos adjust dealers pay/bonus based on how fast they deal/how much they win?"

1) If the rules aren't clearly stated on the website would it be best to call casinos to ask or wing it when I get there? I live very close to Biloxi so there are many casinos to choose from.
2) Once I find a casino with reasonable rules and low limits I'm going to go and just practice counting and basic strategy by flat-betting. Should I get a players card to reap the benefits of food/comps if I'm just going to be flat betting and at the low limits tables?

Everyone on the table hit their hand, no one busted. Dealer flipped his card and he had an ace underneath. He never checked for blackjack. He called the pit boss over and I was told I had to give back what I was paid out. I understand this would have been a push anyways... but have never seen something like this. Usually when it is dealer error, they will let you keep the payouts. Anyone else ever encounter this?"
blackjack,What kind of advantage is this?,"So this year I started to get into card counting, and honestly I feel like I've gotten pretty good at it. I've made a substantial amount of money over the course of the last 6 months.

Here are the rules:

2 deck face up pitch
Double on 10 and 11
Double after split
Split up to 3 aces
3:2 blackjack
Dealer hits soft 17

Penetration is anywhere between 50-85% depending on the dealer. There are a couple of really solid dealers I scope out who give awesome pen.  Obviously the dealers who are giving out 80ish percent pen are a much bigger advantage for me than the 50%.

If you hit this area you get free shows from the casino, hockey tickets, and many more things from the casinos themselves. Not if you can count cards though. Highest you can play is the 100$/hand up to 2000$/hand and up to 3 spots. 

The rules are meh for the game. I feel like the 0heat makes up for this game however. 

8deck, 3:2, H17, Hand shuffled, 80%pen, split up to 4 times, no surrender, no resplitting aces, DAS, double any card. 

All quebec casinos have the same rules as the lottery and gambling is ran by the provincial government. Better off comming to Montreal as it's the easiest to get to.

blackjack,Why are so many blackjack players assholes?,"I've sat down at a table about 5 times the past 3 months. Been lurking here about 2 months trying to pick things up. 

First time I was playing I sat at the end cause it was open. $5 min table. I'm practicing counting but not betting based on it. Trying to see if I can keep count with distractions. The Guy on first base split his 4s. Got another 4 and split it. He had 100 dollars on each hand. His hands ranged from 15-19. I have a 12 against the dealer's 2. The book says hit it so I do. The guy winced and another woman at the table did as well. I get a King and bust. The dealer flips over a queen pulls a 3 then a 5 for 20. The woman turns to me and says you just cost him 600 dollars. I then get berated by the guy and her for the next few hands until I leave about how I don't know how to play. Completely threw me off.  It's a fucking 5 dollar table. Terrible first experience but I came back a couple weeks later and had a few fun tables.

&amp;#x200B;

The latest one this morning I'm playing with just me and another guy.  It's a 5 dollar table as well with lucky ladies side bet. This guy is playing it pretty heavy. I throw a 5 on it a couple times when the running count is &gt; +10 (I think I'm doing this a little early but the count only got this high a couple times) because it also pays 4 to 1 if you first two cards are 10s.  I had a 5 on the side bet this hand and so did he.  His first card is a Queen of hearts and I could tell by his body language it caught his attention. His second card was a king. I say ""hey man at least it's still a win"" as he got paid $20 for it. He replies ""don't say that"". I'm about to explain myself and he says ""No, really don't say that"". The dealer is showing a jack and flips over a queen and he replies with ""see"". I then say I was talking about the side bet man. Your first card was a Q of hearts.

blackjack,"Starting Out, Need To Grasp A Couple Concepts","Recently I gained interest in playing perfect Blackjack. I learned how to count cards a long time ago, and just did it for fun when playing apps and stuff, but never really applied it. So I have that aspect down. Now that I am old enough to go to casinos, I want to throw some money into another account and see how playing with +EV goes. So here are a couple of questions I have: 

&amp;#x200B;

When you say that you are averaging a 1% or 2% edge, are you expecting to take home, or make let's say $10 to $20 if you bring a $1,000 stack? Or are you thinking that you should be winning over the long run after many, many hands? Should you be expecting a profit every session since you have an edge? (I understand variance, I'm not expecting to actually win every session)

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that bet spreading is a thing, but when you look at charts, you are supposed to place 0 units when the count is 0 or negative. How is that? You can't bet 0 units unless you walk away. What does that even mean? I have been betting 1 unit until you get to a positive count. Please let me know!"

blackjack,How Horribly Wrong Is This System?,"I want to start this by saying that I'm not a Blackjack player. My friend and I usually play poker on our game night, but tonight we decided to play Blackjack. As I was playing, I started using a system that made sense to me: 

If you dont hit on a 12 or higher, then you will never bust. The dealer is forced to chase the 17-21, so they are the only ones who can bust. The hands that gou get that are between 17 and 21 are just eliminating the chances that the dealer gets there. 

We combined this with a betting system that my friend found on the internet, where you bet 5, then if you lose you bet 15, then 35, then 75 and so on. It seemed unlikely that you'd lose 8 in a row, so we did the math and you would need a stack of something like 2400. 

We went through a 3 deck stack 4 times and made a profit of $600 (fake money of course)  

This honestly seems way too good t ok be true and my friend is about ready to take money out of his savings because he thinks this is an amazing ""find."" However i think it's a little too simple, and if it were this easy, everyone would be doing it. 

Does anyone have some insight on this? Could you explain why this is a horrible idea for him? Or if it isn't, then hey, I'd bring a couple thousand to my casino and be happy to make some money lol"

blackjack,Beginner’s luck?,"Hey guys, been studying a lot of blackjack recently and I’ve been shopping around for a good penetration 6-deck as I’m not in like a huge city or anything.

3rd time I went out which was a week ago, I took out $100 and cashed out for 135 a few hours later just playing without basic strategy knowledge. Then I studied over the week and went out again last night with 135 and cashed out at 205 after 5-6 hours. Both times I was up probably 100-200 and cashed out on the way down. At the 135 cashout casino, I’m not sure what the penetration was but I know it was a 6 deck. At the 205 casino, the penetration was about 60-70%, but they let you double again after you already doubled. No surrender and hits on soft 17. Blackjack is 3:2 for all these casinos.

Went out to a different casino tonight with the same 205, and after an hour I cashed out with 575. Now, I cashed out at the top right after winning a huge double, lowest I got was probably around 90 bucks. The thing that got me thinking was that they told me it was a 6deck, but they were using this machine/shoe to shuffle everything. They would deal cards out of there and after one deck was in the discard bin they would put it back in this shoe. Being a beginner, I have no idea if this changes my game and/or if it’s a good thing or not. 

The obvious positive I can see is that I can play way more hands this way and counting cards will be easier since I don’t ever have to worry about more than 1 deck. A negative would be the fact that I can’t tell what the penetrations is.

Anyone got info?

TLDR: 5th time playing blackjack, bought in for 205 and cashed out for 575. Casino was 6deck, hits soft 17, 3:2 and no surrender. Casino was using this machine/shoe to deal out of, can anyone tell me if I should go back?"

blackjack,Do you believe in bad decks?,"Every now and then there seem to be decks that the table just can't seem to win at.  Dealer shows a face every hand, players bust on all their 12's, 13, 
Double downs have a low success rate.

It seems that at these tables its a struggle to stay even, and my time at them almost inevitably ends with the dealer going on a run and busting the entire table.

I've come to believe that certain decks, because of the individual composition of the cards and the formulaic way dealers shuffle, are just not condusive to players winning; 

Obviously the shuffling does not truly ""randomize"" the cards; Actually, the way the dealers pick up busted hands makes me feel like when they shuffle, the busted cards get put into almost the same order afterwards. 

When players tell you that its ""bad"" at a table, it usually is.   

Has anyone else seen or experienced this?

blackjack,"Non-CSM Blackjack in London, UK","Hi all,

There are a few posts about this already but most are over a year old.

I'm wondering what recommendations any of the London-based players on here had for the best Blackjack spots?  I saw Napoleon's mentioned a lot on here because they didn't use CSMs and used 4 decks but Napoleons has since disappeared, now replaced by Horizons Casino which exclusively uses CSMs.  Golden Nugget has been mentioned but has also shut down as well.

I was in Empire last night and they have £5 blackjack, but exclusively CSM too.  Hippodrome has shoe-dealt (6 decks, I think) £10 minimum but I'm looking for alternatives, preferably £5 and without CSMs.

blackjack,Seeking info on varying bets,"I am currently working on a semester project for a software engineering course, and I thought blackjack would be a fun game to play around with. 

I’ve already developed the game, however I find simulating thousands of hands of blackjack to test different strategies more fascinating so that’s the main avenue I’ve been pursuing. 

I’ve already written logic to always follow basic strategy, and my next step will be writing a neural network to learn how to count cards to try and gain and edge over the house.  

My question is this: will using my basic strategy logic for the actual move decisions and use the neural network to learn how to vary bets be a suitable approach? 

I know that technically basic strategy changes based on the count of the deck, but I’m wondering how much does this really effect your odds. 

The alternative would be train two neural networks; one where it learns which move to make based on the count of the deck, the players hand, and dealers top card; and another where it learns how much to bet based on the count of the deck. The former network would (seemingly) be much harder to train because the possibilities are much more complex. 

Is my current approach valid? Thanks. "
blackjack,Do bad players negatively affect the table?,"Was playing a few hours ago and a guy sits down at a table I was on that had already two players and myself on it. Usually don't mind if new people sit at the table as long as they aren't hopping in and out of hands. Around 10 hands go by and this guy is standing on every 12 or above regardless of the dealers up card. This would normally bother me but I was winning the majority of the hands so I let it slide. Then this happened: Dealer has a 5 up, I have a 10 with 4x my normal bet on the table, and he has a 20. I double my hand and get my 10 which I was ecstatic about. He decides to split his 20 (sigh, but ok) and gets an 18 and a 15, and then this fucker decides to hit his 15 (everyone was like wtf) and he busts... Dealer ends up drawing to 21 and the whole table lost (Dealer would've busted if this guy did what he was supposed to and didn't hit the 15). The whole table starts laying into this guy (which they should) and I make a quick comment and take my money to another table. TDLR: Do you guys think that bad players that play hands horribly wrong negatively affect the table?"
blackjack,Ideal number of hands on a table for an AP?,"I just want to confirm my suspicions about the number of hands on the table affecting the good hands you can have during a good count. I've had varying success during my counting career (because there is obviously some variance in this game), but it seems when the table is full (and me playing 2 hands), that 20s aren't happening as frequently. I had a session last night with the table full, and the index being around 6 for a good 5 hands.

I only got a 20 once. Most of the table were getting 10s, but low cards to go with them. The dealer was showing 10s and Aces consistently for their hole card. I mean I would assume the more hands in the game, the less concentrated 20s and 21s will be dealt during a good count, right?
Needless to say that session didn't end very well.

What are your guys' perspective on this? Do you APs play on a table when all other hands are occupied? Is it simply just variance? Have you guys had success on full tables? The great sessions i've had in the past I believe is when there were 4 total hands on the table (2 are mine, 2 others from other players). It is nearly impossible to play head on with the dealer at any casino i've been to, no matter the time. So I haven't really been able to test that yet."

blackjack,Finally had my first heckler at the tables last night.,"I was sitting down playing a $25 game and there was a drunk player right next to me. He was shouting at everyone how to play their hands. After a few minutes I had enough and told him I know how to play basic strategy and to mind his hand only. He seemed pissed about this but quieted down. A few hands afterwards, a player hit a 13 vs a dealer's 6 upcard and the guy exploded. Started berating this poor indian man with derogatory words and whatnot. After the hand was over he lectured the player on how he should have stood because the dealer would have busted. Just to prove his point he counted the next two cards the dealer dealt and loudly exclaimed ""SEE""? with such smugness. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was up $100 after ten minutes or so and he turned back to me and said that I don't know how to bet correctly. My blood boiled and I immediately told him that I'm only playing basic strategy and not counting. I told him that progressive betting systems don't guarantee you'll leave a winner anyways. He snaps and starts shouting that he studied the books from Thorp and Wong and Griffin and got so loud to the point where the dealer paused the game and the PB came over.

blackjack,"Question: Assuming you are a dealer, how do you detect that the player is using the strategy?","Before entering the subject, is there any act banned by the casino other than counting? I mean, if you play only by following the basic strategy, will the casino ban play?

As a main theme, I want to make a system that the dealer detects what kind of strategy the player is taking.

Thus I want to know how the dealer detects them.

Using that system, I'm planning to use it to generate a strategy which is hard to be detected by the dealer."
blackjack,REKO,"Has anyone here actually used the REKO count instead of the hi-lo?

I am very impressed by how easy it is, and tempted to try it. It just feels like I might be less likely to make any mistakes, (thereby probably wiping out any +ve edge).  Rather than start at a very low negative number I would start at zero and adjust the betting increases and deviations from BS accordingly. Any thoughts? I am in the UK if it matters."
blackjack,Knockout vs Hi-lo,"I've been practicing for a week or 2 now, I'm pretty good at counting down decks and almost mastered basic strategy, but for the life of me I cannot convert the running count into a true count, the running count can sometimes reach a really high number. I found [this](https://www.qfit.com/KO-HiLo-BlackjackComparison.htm) and it says knock out is about equal to hi-lo. I can't really find anymore info comparing the two systems.
Also what are some general book recommendations? I read an amazon review which says that Professional Blackjack by Stanford Wong is a bit outdated."

The PB doesn't know me at this casino since I am mainly a slot player, so it's not like she thought I was an AP trying to avoid detection.

I've heard most of the time the deck tends to balance at a count of 0.
How often do you find that there is an advantage?  

I always see the stories of how great the count got and how big the bets got, but is this common or is most of the time spent min betting and playing bs?  Do you do some aggressive ramping up once the count starts to get good?  Some of the stories make it seem like its pretty common- getting backed off after 20 mins, winning a alot of money in a short amount of time, so I'm curious how what it actually looks like.  

I've posted a few times so you probably know that I still can't really count and mostly play because I like the rush (of being a degen haha): How big of an advantage do you think you get from following the cards so closely over just betting big when you know there has been more +1 cards than -1 cards?

blackjack,"Assuming equal level skill in their respective craft, what is more reliable? Card counting in blackjack or high level poker?","My obsession with cards, casinos, gambling and math are at a tipping point. I need to satisfy the hunger and get involved but I'm torn as to what avenue to jump into. My natural skillset lends itself to card counting better (I'm good at training muscle memory/automatic actions) vs. the raw computation of odds and stats in a poker game. I don't handle that as well, it would require more training. 

Nevertheless, I wanted to ask for people to hypothesize what is a more reliable action (or profession, hobby, choose your nomenclature here) from a purely profit earning potential? 

For me personally, I would practice at a near professional level (6-8 hours a day) but only actually play at a hobbyist level. (My day job is too cushy to walk away from right now). I live within 50 miles of a whopping 7 casinos, one of which is in Canada so I have a lot of options. Road trips are frequent so I'd be able to put my methods into action reliably at a decent pool of varying casinos, but not at a professional level. (not including any online opportunities available from home.) 


The availability of poker online and it's lower bankroll requirements give it a much lower barrier of entry but the proliferation of automation and bots really turn me off of the idea of investing hard time into it. 

What are your thoughts on the two? Is there a third option I'm not thinking of? Sports betting perhaps?

Yesterday I met my parents at a local casino; they were dropping off something I forgot at their place and we figured we'd do some gaming.

Now, I knew what was in store as far as BJ games available and pretty much decided I'd only play a couple hands for fun, if at all.  The only ""blackjack game"" in my stakes range, was Stadium Blackjack.  8 deck, 6-5, H17.  Fucking brutal.  No thanks.  
  
The dealer is dealing out one hand for up to 30 players or so, and everyone can play the same hand however they like by pushing buttons on their personal electronic terminal.  If somebody hits, the card is added out to the 'Community Cards' field.  So, you can count at this game, as you can see every card that is dealt very easily, but with the house edge being so brutal I doubt it could ever be worth it. 

Anyways, as I was driving home, I was wondering if basic strategy even applies for stadium Blackjack.  With everyone hitting/standing etc. on the same hand, does BS still work?"

Dealer hits Soft 17.

I had a pair of 8's against the dealers 8

I split the 8's 

Got a third 8 and split that also.

On the first 2 splits, I got 10's but on the last one I got a 3.

Ideally, I would double down but the last split was all the money I had left. I hit it instead and got a 4.

I hit again but got a 10 and busted out.

Dealer turns over his card and has a pair of 8's and hits a 4 to get 20.

blackjack,How to prove my friend wrong,"So me and some buddies were hanging out, and then casinos came up, then blackjack. My friend said the house edge was from 70 to 80%, and I told them that was simply not true. They thought I was near crazy when I explained what the real edge was approximately, so then of course we looked it up. When we found multiple sites saying the house edge was 2 to 3% for the average player, and 0.5 for the perfect BS player, they denied it. They said since there were no ""numbers to prove that, it didn't count. They then found stats for when the dealer busts and then took the average percent the dealer bust and took that as the house edge. I explained that was not true since you can win when the dealer doesn't bust, you can hit blackjacks for 3:2, split, double and etc. They wouldn't listen to my argument since I didn't have numbers to back up the 2-3% house edge stat, and players playing abilities are subjective. So, my question is, does anyone have any links to any numbers that show how the house edge compared to average player is calculated, I'm having trouble finding it myself. (Specific calculations, not just explanations.) Nothing else I show them number or logic wise seems to be convincing them, and I'm incredibly petty and frustrated with this argument and can't drop it."
blackjack,Total Noob to Black Jack - I have an online casino question in regards to variance.,"Hello everyone,

I am a super noob at black jack so I apologize if this is a dumb question...

In terms of variance, how normal or unusual is this hand history I have?

I decided to play 300 hands of online black jack (single deck) on America's Card Room at $1 per hand. I marked every single hand down on a piece of paper as an experiment. I expected to be a slight loser over the course of 300 hands, and used very basic strategy I got from this sub reddit.

Out of the 300 hands I played, I documented that the dealer either flopped 21 or hit 21,  47 out of the 300 hands. The dealer also pushed 20, when I also had 20....  27 out of the 300 hands. Now I know that black jack is already rigged in the houses favor. (Like 53% to 47%), but is there anything unusual about this small sample size?

I've got a couple programs/apps already, but recommendations would be great as I really don't know what is good and what isn't at this stage.

I was under the impression that they sell these cards at the casino and that you're able to bring them to the table? (I do understand that the house has an edge). Or do they just mean that having the basic strategy down pat is a prerequisite to moving on to learning to count cards? 

Similarly, when people talk on this sub, is is commonly about counting cards? Forgive my ignorance. And is counting cards still viable? I was under the impression that it isn't these days with the way that games are designed in casinos."

blackjack,Noob looking for tips,So I played my first game of blackjack yesterday at a festival and the min was $1 and max was $5 and took your money if you and dealer went even number (heard you keep your money at a real casino if that was the case.) started $30 and went even the whole day and lost $30 at the 2nd day :( pretty upsetting but I had fun and learned something. Do you guys have any tips? I usually hit on 11-14 but my luck is so bad when hitting because I get a face card often when I do it. Also if your at a low number and the dealer has a face do you basically have to push your luck and hit?

blackjack,"Does playing with ""bad players"" truly decrease your odds of winning?","Sorry if this is a dumb question but I'm looking for a mathematical explanation for why good players claim that playing with bad players decreases their odds of winning.

And yes, I'm just now getting into Blackjack. I know little beyond basic strategy.


Obviously it sucks when you watch a bad player hit, and they're dealt a card that should have been dealt to the dealer and would have caused the dealer to bust. I realize those situations ruins it for the whole table. Or similarly, the player to your right hits when he shouldn't and is dealt a card that would have better suited you instead.

But I think these moments just ""feel bad."" They don't statistically ruin your odds when making plays like this, do they? The one card they change in a deck of 6 or so seems negligible.

blackjack,Why does the dealer sometimes take unnecessary extra cards?,"Ive been practicing online today after playing in vegas once few weeks back.

The question I have is: When I got a King and a 4, and the dealer has a face up 6 (a bust card). I stayed cuz it was higher than 12. When the dealer flipped the card over, they had a King as well, giving them 16. But they drew another card and busted out at 25 giving me my money. Why is it that sometimes the dealers take additional cards when they do not need to? Is there a rule Im missing?

Edit: Also, when I have a 19, and the dealer flips their card and has a 17, why do they stay. Why don't they just try their luck for the 21 since they will lose either way why not draw and have some chance of winning? Is there another rule here I'm missing?"

blackjack,Opinion: The Risk of Ruin Formula is kinda flawed.,"Backstory: For the past couple of months, I've been trying to beat the dealer, so to speak. There is a free Steam game called Four Kings Casino and Slots. Needless to say, they have blackjack tables. The developers of the game when it was released talked about how it was scripted, and that if anyone started card counting, they could beat it. 

This has been my little project for quite some time now. The game does have it's flaws. The table rules may not be perfect, but they are good enough for this project. One downside is you cannot count the decks. To combat this, I use the Red Seven Count since deck estimation isn't used - just the running count. I am also following Arnold Snyder's rules to the T when it comes to betting. My goal is to double my starting bankroll. 

Currently, I've played 79 shoes (~30 hours) and play near perfect basic strategy for the table rules. I'll be honest. I know I make a mistake here and there as I am human and I also don't deviate from basic strategy. Again, this is just a test/training exercise. 

I also account for every session - with starting bankroll, ending bankroll, shoes played, win/loss, and then comments on what happened. 

I started with $22,268 and now I am down to $10,441. The last four sessions have been a $10,000 loss. My high was $26,826 after session 13. I suspect two things might be happening. I am either experiencing very, very bad variance. Or this is experience is just a statistic as some AP players have to be 'ruined'. The Risk of Ruin formula says so. Perhaps if I was using the Ken Uston APC method or a simple Hi-Lo method - if it was at all possible - I may not be in this predicament. That's quite a thought: my risk of ruin would be lessened if I used this more advanced method of card counting. To my knowledge, I don't think the RoR formula takes into account the efficacy of the chosen card counting system. I think that's something to think about....

blackjack,Double deck advice,"This one particular shop near me has a $5-$100 H17 DAS DOA DD game where I noticed the penetration varies from dealer to dealer significantly. A couple of the dealers were giving something like 75 maybe 80% pen while some of the others were only giving like 50%. This makes the game pretty damn good if I were to sit out the low pen decks. The pit also didn't care when I was spreading 1-20. The problem is I have some reason to believe they're cheating, we played through 2 DD shoes (1st shoe blue cards, 2nd red cards). After opening the auto shuffler when we completed the 2nd play through of the blue cards there was a small stack of maybe a quarter deck still in the machine. The dealer just pulled out the quarter deck stack that was sitting in the machine and added it to the rest of the blue cards so they could all be shuffled together. I've never seen this happen. Not to mention first time I was in this Indian casino my instincts just told me it is sketchy."

blackjack,Splitting question,"Greetings,

I have a burning question regarding splitting.

I'm coding a blackjack game using python and I need to clear something up regarding splits, but since I haven't actually played at a casino in years, I have forgotten how the split cards are handled. When you split a hand, say a pair of 8s, do you get one card on each hand right away? Or do you only get a card on the first '8' while the second '8' waits until you are finished with the first hand? 

As far as I remember from my playing days, each hand would get a card right away, but I've been seeing some footage online where they only draw a card to the hand currently in play. Also, if you get another matching card on the first hand and resplit it, does this 3rd '8' becomes the next hand, or does it go to the end of the playing order and become the last hand to be played?

Thanks in advance"
blackjack,"If not an AP but following perfect BS, are CSMs preferable?","Disclaimer: I am NOT advocating that CSMs are beatable.  I just want to see your guys' thought on optimal game selection for a non-AP who enjoys the game of blackjack. Bit of a long post.

Consider the following rule set for a 3:2 game: H17, DAS, RSA, surrender allowed on first two cards, 6 decks in a CSM where the dealer cycles the cards back into the CSM after each round.

A non-AP sits alone at the CSM table; let's call him Andy. He's using a basic strategy card for 6-deck blackjack, and firmly believes that he should always following this basic strategy card. Andy is dealt a 10-3, vs dealer showing 3. His card tells him to stand, and I believe he is correct in doing so.

Ignoring the outcome of the previous scenario, let's consider the same situation, except Andy is playing at a 6-deck shoe game instead of the CSM. He's halfway through the shoe, and according to Hi-Lo, the TC is a dismal -5. Andy is unaware of this, of course, as he's not attempting any advantage play. Andy is again dealt a hard 13, vs dealer showing 3. His basic strategy card tells him to stand, but the index play here indicates otherwise, and he should take exactly one card when the TC is less than -2 to better his odds.

Assuming that CSMs practically always have a TC of approximately 0 if the dealer cycles the cards back in every round (maybe give or take 1, depending on the cards revealed from the single deal before you perform any action), I believe Andy would better off playing at a table with a CSM than a regular shoe game, because there are significantly fewer deviations from basic strategy he ought to be taking. Thoughts?"

blackjack,$60 ——&gt; $530,"“Mini” BlackJack Diary - WARNING, VERY LENGTHY NOVEL

Hello guys, me and my family took a round trip tour throughout the United States - with California being our destination.

I live in Ohio and we dropped by Vegas for only 2 days. Just a little story about my profit and losses and where I played.

The hotel we stayed at was Harrah’s (AMAZING place for a little vacay stay btw but AWFUL for blackjack because of the crud rules.)

I had learned BJ with friends a few years prior to this trip because of poker, but never played seriously or practiced before this.

I had only studied a couple of days before this trip because I have a horrible habit of doing things last minute.

I am a Computer science major and study astrophysics for fun, so naturally I am able to crunch numbers without much effort.

My studies were all done within a 4 DAY SPAN.
My actual play was done on days 3 AND 4.

I start out with a $200 bankroll for cushion, and only play with $20 buy-ins at a time to pull away when I need to.



DAY 1 —

2 Days prior to hitting Vegas, I knew virtually NOTHING about Blackjack and had taken it upon myself to learn basic strategy.

I had already KNEW how to count with the Hi-Lo system because - as I mentioned - I counted while playing poker FOR FUN at the same time as reading hands. Which I know, counting in poker is useless, but might as well kill two birds with one stone.

I learned basic strategy within this first day using android BJ practice apps, and solidified my memory with lots of water and good sleep.

This was 7+ hours of practice, as I was stuck in the car for the drive there.



DAY 2 —

I decided to squeeze as much info out of this as I could, so I learned the Wong Halves system on this day.

I also searched online hardcore for the best places to play with the BEST rules.
Unfortunately, this was useless because we ended up staying at HARRAH’s (known for its shit rules).

For the Wong Halves, this was another 7+ HOURS of brutal brain numbing practice with 10 minute breaks in between each hour.

This system was very difficult to learn due to the halves system, but provides a bit of a more an accurate count. It was tough building the neurons for this new method, as I was already used to the Hi-Lo system. 

But nonetheless, I was able to blitz an entire deck in just under 30 seconds.



DAY 3 —

So this was it.

We finally arrived around 4pm and checked in with our luggage and took everything upstairs.

As my parents were checking-in, I scanned the entire bottom casino perimeter to get a good look at my prey and what tables to go for. You could almost get lost looking for the restroom, I’d say - I’m sure they designed the place to have a devils grip on your mind.

The first tables in the party pit were intimidating with $15 - $25 minimums! - I was anticipating $5min, as being a broke college student, I know that variance can devour my entire bankroll.

As I was watching, I could BARELY keep count of the cards flying out from the dealers hand.

Already I was sweating. But knowing the cards were being hand-shuffled here, I was a bit relieved.

I decided to turn away and head to the empty back portion of the LINQ hotel, (basically connected to Harrahs), in hopes of finding a table with $5 min.

Luckily I did! But with an ASM and cruddy rules?? :(

I was screwed at that point, with no real hopes of winning. I decided to go for it and use basic strategy and practice counting while I was there.

I failed MISERABLY, and could BARELY keep track of half the cards that were coming out. My first $20 basically flew out of my hands.

With the night closing in for us, nearing almost 6pm, my family decided that it was time to leave and head out to eat.



DAY 3 — 6:30pm, MAIN ST. Garden Court Buffet


SORELY deceived and mislead, I had already dropped my hopes of having any edge against the house. “How could I be defeated so easily? I get that it was only $20 to start out, but have the rules around here really run to shit?”

After dinner, while my family is finishing eating, I decide to depressingly look around for tables.....


There it is....the fucking holy grail of BlackJack tables. BJ pays 3:2, and dealer hits on S17, with only 2 decks.

I almost cry with joy.

As any good player, I decide to sit back and watch the other players first and how they play.

2 older guys sitting next to each other, one stacking, one not.

The one stacking is generating heat, as passerby’s seem to notice the chips building high. The pit boss notices as well and eyes him the entire time he’s there. I had a feeling he was counting as he was spreading his bets on 4+ count, and I think he was also using a progression system. Who knows. The guy leaves.

I jump in, and am the only one at the table.

I whip out $20, unfamiliar with the game, the dealer is adjusting my mistakes every 20 seconds as I unnecessarily flip the cards over when I’m not supposed to and touch them when I’m not supposed to.

This immediately turns me off from counting.

So I turn to basic strategy and win the first few hands. I struggle through the variance and run this all the way up to $120 within the first 20 minutes!!

My family finishes dinner and comes to get me.  

If it weren’t for those meddling kids, I’m sure I’d be up more! - Only kidding. I would have tilted and lost it all like the first time at LINQS, had it not been for their intervention :)

I was happy the entire night, with my bank roll starting out with $200, losing a $20 buy-in at first and then returning that with $120, I was invincible!!! Only $80 profit in total :(

I did not know how to cut my losses.

I wanted more.

11PM, THE VENETIAN - NEW BLACKJACK $5min COLOSSEUM FORMAT

That same night I decided to explore The Venetian. They had a new colosseum style blackjack game with the same crap rules.

I sit down with my $20 buy-in and go to town.
It’s quite a long grind, as I ran it up to $60 in 20 minutes.

The free drinks start coming in. And a new guy sits next to me. He is also a Computer science major.

We talk for awhile, have a couple drinks and smokes (I normally don’t smoke cigs, only mary) and we both run up to $140 after about an hour and a half of playing total.

Lady Luck was on my side that night.

I am up a total of $260 in one day. Not bad for $20 buy-in. I decide to call it a night.



DAY 4 — LAST DAY AT HARRAH’S

It was night time at Harrah’s and we had arrived after walking down the Vegas strip and visiting the different casinos.

Mind you this was on July 4th so before arriving to the party pit tables my family was anticipating fireworks to be displayed on the strip that night (it was actually displayed 2 days before July 4th?? Bleh, whatever.)

So me and my mother decide to sit down at the $10 minimum tables - and thank god Harrahs even had a few 10$ min - after she had lost roughly $60 at the 3 card poker table.

I pull out $20 for a buy-in (I know, I know, awful idea but I do it anyways.

I get so freaking lucky and win the first couple of hands, I run it all the way to $220 in 40 minutes! All the while helping my mother gain back her profit as well.

I begin to lose 4 consecutive hands and decided to cut my losses at $170!!



I cash out with a total profit $430 added to my bankroll ($610 total!) and for the rest of the trip, I am a happy, happy boy. 22 and broke never felt so good.

I am actually quite afraid to play again, as there are no good tables in Columbus, Ohio. But am eager to study more.

If you guys have any tips or advice, please let me know.

That’s my story, thank you guys for reading.

As always, happy hunting!

blackjack,"My first time playing. Started with 200, how’d I do?",
blackjack,Possible case for Progressive betting (1000 trials of 500 hands each),"I may share the trial results in Google Sheets if there is any interest.  I am a Database programmer/admin by trade.

The progression I tested is one I made up myself, however I wouldn't be surprised if someone else created it and named it.

Some terminology that might help, trial = 500 hands from one 8-deck shoe with 1 player playing 1 hand per deal.

---------------

2-4-4-10 (20 units over 3 consecutive wins leading into 4th bet), every loss resets to 2 unit bet

vs.

flat 5 unit betting throughout the shoe.

---------------

Keep in mind, without counting cards, the player is expected to win less than 50% of the shoes (500 hands).

I ran my trials using a random 50/50 win probability per hand to keep it simple, out of 1000 trials of 500 hands each, 

    Trials where player won more hands = 506
    Trials where house won more hands = 494

when your blackjack **winrate was 48% or less...**
22 (12%) times out of 184 (18.4%) trials flat betting was better overall than progressive betting loss ($264,200) more money. ($1,435.87) average per shoe

--------------

when your blackjack **winrate was between 48 and 50%...**
133 (43%) times out of 310 (31%) trials flat betting was better overall than progressive betting loss ($88,000) more money. ($283.87) average per shoe

when your blackjack **winrate was between 50 and 52%...**
183 (59%) times out of 310 (31%) trials flat betting was better overall than progressive betting gained $99,200 more money. $320.00 average per shoe

**(summary)**

when your blackjack **winrate was between 48 and 52%...**
316 (51%) times out of 620 (62%) trials flat betting was better overall than progressive betting gained $11,200 more money. $18.06 average per shoe

--------------

when your blackjack **winrate was 52% or more...**
172 (88%) times out of 196 (19.6%) trials flat betting was better overall than progressive betting gained $241,250 more money. $1,230.87 average

blackjack,first time playing in a while 29% roi using 1-3-2-6 progression,"Are progressions frowned upon here?  Was sitting at a table with a few other guys that had higher base bets and they were modifying their bets it seemed at whim, don't think they were winning.

For those not familiar, if your base bet is $25, every time you lose you return to $25, every time you win you modify your bet from $25 to $75-$50-$150 then you reset back to $25, so if you lose your last bet (in the sequence, $150) you break even.  If you push at any point I just rebet same amount.  You play splits and double downs as normal regardless of what level you are at.

blackjack,Took about 3 weeks of practice to finally walk in the casino but this shit is awesome,"It took about 3 weeks of nailing basic strategy into my head and keeping an accurate count, but I’ve had some successful small trial runs the last two nights and it feels awesome. 

My first real attempt was last night and before then I had not practiced keeping count for multiple hands so I had to eyeball it (mistake #1). I still went up to 120 from 80 but got eaten up by about $25 of hand fees (mistake #2) 

To fix it I spent all day today practicing keeping an accurate count for 5 hands until I was able to consistently end up at an even count at the end of the deck. Then we got to the nino we found a $10 min with no hand fee and I told my buddy to follow my lead as I kept count. 

For the first 3 shoes I was getting shat on by hard 13’s while I watched my buddy get next to me get multiple blackjacks one after another, he was up 150 from 60 and I was down to 60 from 100. I felt like an idiot, the count was always hovering at -10 and I couldn’t get a streak going (not to mention the piss drunk guy next to me that split 10’s three times, won them all, and somehow correctly called his next card like 50% of the time). I kept my cool through it all and waited for the 26’s to roll around on another shoe. 

Turns out keeping your cool actually works out 🤷🏻‍♂️. New dealer came in along with a new shoe, and started spewing out low cards left and right... I climbed back up to break even around 3/4 through the stack when the count started to rise up to +10 and higher. I jumped on the opportunity and threw down 40, deal comes around and I’m dealt hard 13 with dealer bust card and he goes over. Next hand threw an extra 5 chip on top and get dealt virtually the same hand, dealer busts. With a few more slightly ballsy bets (win and lose) I’m now at around 200 and the deck cooled down so I finish out the shoe by flat betting and I stay up. 

Hopefully within the next few weeks I can get good enough to play with a higher bankroll and make some real money but this is starting to look like it can work :)"
blackjack,Should I stay away?,"I currently live in Curacao and have experience counting from when I lived in the US.  Recently moved here and I'm exploring the places with decent games.

Last night I hit a casino with a decent game and sat down for 3 shoes.  I was playing $5 min, then when the count was good, I'd throw out 2 hands of $75.

I was being watched by 2 pit bosses by the start 3rd shoe, and I tried to make him think I was dumb by standing on a hard 13 vs. 10 (it was a $5 bet away).  He walked away for a minute, then returned shortly after and watched me like a hawk.

The end of the 3rd shoe I colored up and was up about $200.  He followed me to the cage and stood there and watched me cash out.  The cashier received a phone call while she was handling my chips, and before handing me the money after she counted it out twice, she asked for my ID, to which I said I didn't have it with me.

This was by far the largest amount of heat I've gotten from playing, other than pit bosses watching my play.  Is it safe to say I should play elsewhere?"
blackjack,First Time Heavy Heat...,"First time I had what felt like major heat. 

Was playing at my local spot. $50 Min Table. I had only been playing for 20-30 minutes when suits arrived to the floor. 

I just had a weird feeling I was being watched. 

Then... Dealer Change. 

Moments later a guy in a suit, casual, looked like he could have just been there, came up and kinda hovered behind me. 

I hit a small streak. Each win the guy would like kinda cheer me on. Then fist bump me... 

I was like. Dude bug off. (Not really). I gave him a fist bump but felt very annoyed. 

I wasnt sure at that point if he was eyeing my chips or watching my play. 

Then, I hit an 8888 split to 4 hands. Doubled on two as I was holding 10 or 11 on those against D5. 

So I had 4 hands. $100 $200 $100 $200.

Dealer turned hole card. Queen. Hit 10 and bust. 

GUESS WHAT. 

Fist Bump. Sigh. 

Anyways so I made a comment along the lines of “Finally! I needed that. Still down though.”

He Responded “*I know...*” as if he was sympathetic. Knda like shaking his head like “I hear ya”. 

***WTF***

I turned to him and looked right at him and asked “How do you know?”

He looked back, kinda caught off guard... and said “uh what”?

Then the dealer leaned in and firmly said “He asked How Do You Know”?

He just kinda looked at me the dealer, away, then said “I can just tell man... I can just tell”...

He left. Just wandered away. 

That was it. Weird?

So last night I was playing in a semi full table with 5 people. Dealer was showing a 7 up card and everyone had cards from the range of 12-13. The first three players hit and caught low ""+1"" cards  5x in a row. They didn't bust and got the cards they needed. I'm looking at my 13 and I stand.  The last guy, the anchor doesn't hit either with his 14. Dealer turns his down card and catches a 15 and was force to hit and bust. I look at anchor and I gave him a high five and I said, I really thought you were going to hit. His response was If you didn't hit I wouldn't hit. I love when the chemistry is on point and things work in our favor. There is always that one table that has a disgruntled player who yells at someone for not betting by the book.

blackjack,Minimum Viable Strategy,"I have this concept I call Minimum Viable Strategy. The name is perhaps deceptive because it actually includes strategy, counting and betting, but essentially the idea is this: what is the easiest way I can obtain a break even expectation?

According to the WOO site that should have a marginally positive expectation (about 0.15%) with liberal Vegas rules. Does anyone know a simpler system that is at least break-even? "
blackjack,New to counting - my first experience in AC,"Just wanted to share my story and ask some people if this is even worth it.  

So I’ve been playing BJ at AC casinos for about 8 years with just BS and I first started practicing counting at home about 2 weeks ago.  I was decent and wanted to try it for real so I drove down to AC.  HiLo.  Couldn’t find great games so we settled for 8deck 75% pen dealer hit on soft 17.  Not great.  Is it even beatable?  The worst part was 15$ minimums so my bet spread was really bad.  I just wanted to practice.  Out of probably about 50 shoes I was able to keep the count fully three or four times.  Other times I had a loose idea.  I know I need practice.  I had a true count of +3 once and never above 2 (that I knew of) at all for the rest of my 5 hours playing.  Variance beat me at the end of that shoe.  Otherwise the large majority of my counts, I think, were between -1 and 1.  So I bet the minimum most of the night.  Didn’t feel like wonging out at all because I just wanted to practice.    So my questions are:     

Is it normal to play for 5 hours and only see a few +1 or higher positive counts in 8deck?     

If it’s not, was I missing positive counts at the end of each shoe?  Like is it normal that on one hand it’s negative then 2 hands later you should be max betting?     

Is it normal to play a shoe and only get the TC +1 or +2 for like 2 hands at the end of it?     

I basically just want to know what typical betting patterns look like and how counts typically fluctuate.   

All in all it was a useful experience and I think with more practice at home I’ll be way better prepared next time.  I know that my first steps should be to continue practicing counting so I don’t lose it and find the best games like in PA, but I would really appreciate it if someone could get into depth about what exactly I’m looking for in terms of the count.  

Thanks.  "
blackjack,Why are The Odds of Doubling Down on a 9v4 Higher than Hitting when TC &lt; 0?,"I am relatively new to black jack and card counting in general.  I am using a game here ([https://wizardofodds.com/play/blackjack-v2/](https://wizardofodds.com/play/blackjack-v2/)) that is meant for practicing card counting.  I have noticed that when I display that stats for a certain hand, and I hold a hard 9 and the dealer is showing a 4, the recommended strategy is to double down.  


Intuitively, that makes no sense to me.  Can anyone clarify this?  If the true count is lower, wouldn't there be \*more\* small hands in the deck?  Wouldn't I simply want to hit if those are the odds, instead of double?  Is it because the dealer has a greater chance of busting from a 4?"

blackjack,How is EV determined based on the True Count?,"I have always wondered this. More specifically, I understand how the total EV for a particular game can be calculated for a non-counter, using basic strategy by finding the probability of every starting hand vs dealer upcard *times* the EV of each starting hand. This was made deceptively simple by a video by Michael Shackleford:

[Basic Blackjack Strategy for Infinite Decks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCF-Btu5ZCk)

He assumes every rank of card (exception of 10 value since there are 4 of them) are equally likely to be drawn from the shoe at any time. It follows that one could insert the individual probabilities of each rank of card, if the composition of the shoe is known. If you are using a Hi-Lo count, then we know how many more hi cards (10,A) there are than lo cards (2,3,4,5,6). There is no information gleaned from this about whether ""2"" is more likely or ""3"". So the best that can be done is to assume 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are equally likely to each other. Likewise, the hi cards are equally likely, so ""10"" is 4x more likely than ""A"".  Same follows for ""7"", ""8"", and ""9"".

My question is, how do the experts figure the likelihood of the ""Hi""s and ""Lo""s vs the ""neutrals"". Knowing the count does not distinguish whether a massive amount of hi and lo cards cancel out or not. For example a 0 count could either be heavy with 7s, 8s, and 9s, or could have many 10s and low cards left. The ratio between neutral cards and important cards isn't known.

Do they assume a certain ratio between them that is most likely? Do they assume there are 3/13 of neutrals left since that is how the deck begins? Or do high and low counts beget a skewed ratio of 7 thru 9s?

blackjack,Is my thinking correct with this?,"I found a side bet that pays 10 to 1 if you tie.

blackjack,Advice on this back off,"This is only the second time I've been backed off. The first time I was at el cortez and it was just a polite flat betting. This one surprised me a bit. I walked into the casino and as I sat down at the table I was immediately surrounded by 3 dudes in suits. They told me I was barred from playing blackjack, but I was welcome to play craps if I wanted. I said 'why, what do you mean?' And one responded, ""you're too good for us."" Other people at the table were shocked and confused at the situation and started defending me. Saying 'why won't you let him play?'. The dudes just ignored them and I told them 'they said I was too good to play, I guess if you win any money they don't let you play anymore'. Two of them were pissed and decided to leave (that was pretty satisfying). Enough about that, I'm sure most of you have experienced this very scenario several times. I'm hoping to get feedback on what I may have done wrong or if it was possible to prevent. 

1. So if any are wondering, this was at suncoast in las vegas. I realize it's known for being a sweaty joint. I played there about one hour per week for about four months straight. I usually played 2 hands (even on negative counts) on the double deck spreading 1-7. Rarely made cover plays except sometimes betting more at the beginning of a shoe. I use the top 45 index plays. I usually wore my work cloths so it looked like I was playing a little bit after work. Too aggressive for this place? 
2. Looking back at my records, I realized that out of 16 sessions there, I had only lost one of them. I usually rat hole, but what can you do when you win too much? 
3. Another questions is, suncoast is owned by boyd gaming who own several casinos I frequently play at. Should I expect a back off at any boyd property moving forward? The funny thing is I was playing earlier at another casino owned by boyd and did not receive any heat at all (or maybe I was being watched and didn't realize it). Will I never be able to return to these casinos now that I've been identified or will I be forgotten with time and employee turnover. 
4. One more thing, I am young as fuck, usually in a sea of old people so I stand out quite a bit. Sometimes I feel like I get attention immediately at some places just because of that fact. Not sure how I can blend in better. 

Apologies for the long winded post. It was actually pretty fun being backed off and gave me an adrenaline rush but I prefer to continue making money. Any advice is appreciated as usual. "

Also it will give you an option to plug in how many decks are being played and it will track the cards that have been played and adjust your chance of winning based on if the deck is hot or not.

That unknown card advantage has to cover,
3/2 black jack pay outs
Double downs 
Ect...


Would it make sense to play the same as the dealer -stay on soft 17-  making the game a coin flip. Then we get paid out 3/2 on black jack, making the odds always over 50 percent?

**SECOND**.      Confirm your bankroll covers your planned session length.  If you plan to play 1 hand per round you could estimate 60 hands per hour at a full table. Your bankroll should be at least (Number of Hands You Expect to Play x Base Bet x 0.5).  Example:   1 Hour of Play with a Base Bet of $50 per hand would require $1500  (60 Hands x $50 Base Bet x 0.5)

Using this above method to determine bankroll, you have roughly a 20&amp;#37; Risk of Ruin for the Session. (Although Unlikely you'd time out at zero bankroll at hand 60). 

**THIRD**.        *THE ACTION:*     Using the Paroli 3, you basically view each hand as ""costing"" your base bet amount.  Meaning over 60 hands hands, you will risk a single base bet. 

**Your GOAL:  Is to win 3 hands in a row. Period. The Progression of the Wagers Works as Follows:**

Assuming a Base Bet of $50. 

**WAGER 1:**  $50

If you lose this hand. You go back to Wager 1. Starting the Progression Over. (This is the exact opposite of Martingale, where a player doubles his bet in the hopes to win back his lost wager). 

If you WIN this hand, proceed to WAGER 2:

**WAGER 2:**  $150.    You press your winning hands bet (the won amount), and you place an additional base bet of $50 on top. 

If you lose this hand, return to WAGER 1. Starting the Progression Over. 

If you WIN this hand, proceed to WAGER 3:

**WAGER 3:**   $350.    Your again press the amount won from Wager 2, and again commit one additional base bet of $50 to this hand. 

If you lose this hand, you go back to WAGER 1. Starting the Progression Over. 

If you WIN....    You ALSO go back to WAGER 1 Starting the Progression Over. 

You Start Back Over - with only your base bet of $50 REGARDLESS of a win or lose on the 3rd hand. 

Your GOAL, is to win three hands in a row, then start over. 

# ANALYSIS OF OUTCOMES:

When you meet the requirement of winning 3 hands in a row, the payout based on a base bet of $50 is **$700** (this is factoring 1:1 payouts and no blackjacks. 

Your amount risked on those specific hands was $150. You added from your bankroll a $50 base bet to each new hand, stopping and resetting after winning the third hand. 

If you lose the 3rd Hand, You have only lost $150 (3 Base Bets); as each of the bets were inflated by pressing of your previous hand's winning amount. 

ODDS:

I don't want to go into to much analysis of the odds of a 3 round streak, as streak outcomes are difficult to predict and also there are various methods to calculate the actual odds of winning X amount of hands in a row. Also, card-counters / AP Players will certainly have a much better edge putting this system into play in High TC Decks, as the odds of a 3 Round Streak in a &gt; +TC 10 would become much higher. 

CLOSING THOUGHTS:

However; and needless to say, a 3 win streak is by no means ""difficult"" to achieve. Winning and losing streaks stretch far longer than 3. And the ""rough odds"" would be about a 12.50&amp;#37; chance, or 1 in 9 chance, of a ""WAGER 1"" would progress to win the WAGER 3 round. 

This system mitigates the out of control and compounding losses the Martingale System is flawed by. Martingale systems are extremely high risk, as you wager more after each loss. Hit a 8 round losing streak, and you will have to wager huge sums to recoup that loss. The risk of ruin is very high. 

With the Paroli 3, you are only risking $50 or whatever your Base Bet is per round. Period. 

You would need to achieve roughly 2.10 ""Three Round Winning Streaks"" per 60 Hands in order to break even. 

All single wins followed by a loss / two win streaks followed by a loss - are just losses of money won. You restart the progression after 3 winning consecutive hands. 

As a final alternative. You could use Blackjacks paid at 3:2 to reduce your risk further, by only having to put up 1/2 your base bet due to the blackjack being paid out at 3:2 thus covering the amount needed to use this system.

blackjack,Playing Blackjack - Tips for Those who Want to Dive In!,"**AS AN AP BLACKJACK PLAYER**:   And I frequent reader / occasional poster on this subreddit. I thought I'd throw down a simple list of ""Tips"" to get in order for anyone new to serious Blackjack gaming.

I hope this post is seen as a good resource for those looking to getting into playing as an AP Player. This is simply what I have learned not just here and on other forums and websites; but also from actual play. Things I'd point out, which aren't really addressed in books/online forums very often.

# u/SugarCoatFree 's           ""AP Blackjack Tips for the New Kids on the Block""

# 

# A POINTER TO START WITH:

Want to play blackjack for profit? Make sure you have **Access.** Don't even bother unless you have close / easy access to at least one huge casino or multiple casinos where you can frequent. It won't be worth the effort. If you only live within a close distance of a small time operation, you'll get too much heat even on nickle tables. I play personally at one casino, but it's a MEGA casino, where players on the open floor bet large sums per hand, and the table minimum is $25-$50 depending on time of day. That said, I fly pretty much under the radar because typically I'm next to two players playing $500 hands or even double that. You have to find not only a good game... with good rules, but also a game you can realistically play for a long time and not get heat or banned.

# BEFORE YOU PLACE YOUR FIRST WAGER

\- **DON'T PAY TO LEARN.**  Before you play a single round at an actual table, yes seriously; why practice your game and lose money doing so...  Make sure you know Basic Strategy for\*\*\* the specific game rule\*\*\*s in which you will be playing. You have to have this down pat.  For this I recommend [Blackjack Trainer Pro for iPad](https://www.appannie.com/en/apps/ios/app/blackjack-trainer-pro-learn/#)

It is $3.99 in the App Store. This App is **FANTASTIC** for learning Basic Strategy. First:

1. It allows you to set up the game rules specific to your actual game. Double Aces Allowed? Surrender? Early or Late? Re-Split Aces? All the options (most), are there.
2. It then creates your Basic Strategy Table which you need to memorize and have down cold.
3. It offers 2 modes of play... Regular Practice &amp; Practice Pairs
4. It has a separate Strategy Table, which looks like a spreadsheet. Each box is color coded and inside it shows how many times you played it correctly. Red to Yellow to Green. This is FANTASTIC, because over time it will show you where your weak spots are... you'll practice 1000s of hands, and can pull up this chart, and see right there:  OK I am only playing 3 3 vs D4 right 58&amp;#37; of the time. The box will be yellowish. You need to get that chart all bright green. It is a great tool.

[Example of \\""Error Chart from Blackjack Trainer Pro\\"" - Newest Update includes &amp;#37; of Played Hands Correct in each Cell](https://i.redd.it/rntsdwzak0411.jpg)

[Blackjack Trainer Pro allows you to set up YOUR game - then it creates the Basic Strategy Chart for YOUR game.](https://i.redd.it/g6w75g00l0411.jpg)

\- **LEARN TO COUNT.**  People who play only Basic Strategy will always be in negative EV. Period. Your luck will run out. Basic Strategy is where you start. Learn to play the game. Until you have basic strategy down, don't even bother learning to count. Because a single mistake per hour of play will likely throw your edge down more than counting raises it. Learn how to play Chess, what the rules are... then you can start learning to think 6 moves ahead. Strategy First. Counting then is Next - and is NECESSARY.

\- Learn to Count Fast. Don't waste time on Apps for this. Just drill yourself with one deck of cards. It's really all you need.

Sitting with a single deck of cards face down in your palm, flip them out one at a time and keep a running count in your head. When the deck is done your count should be 0.

You need to be counting them out accurately, so treat it like learning to play a piano piece. Slow and accurate at first, speed will naturally increase. You don't get good at anything by learning to do it poorly in less time.

Ultimately, get to the point where you can count the deck in under 30 Seconds. A better goal would be 27/28 seconds. But 30 Seconds, accurately, will basically make you able to easily count the rounds dealt while at the same time not look like you are counting and scanning. Because at this speed, you can count faster than the round is played by a factor of 2:1.

Lastly, when you count, don't move your lips, mouth the numbers. It must be all *inner monologue.* Chew gum if you have to.

# GET YOUR BANKROLL TOGETHER

**RISK OF RUIN:**    There are a lot of discussions on ""how much"" you need to play as an AP player to have a low ROR (Risk of Ruin), and survive the variances and swings of losing streaks which will occur.

My Advice is based on my Playing Style:  2-3 Hour Sessions, of which I'll play on average 200-300 hands.

So for a single session, My Initial Buy In is for 16-20 Units ($25 bets) = $400-$500.

I have available for that session 2X additional of which I bought in for = Additional $800-$1000. This is used to buy additional chips if needed to stay in play or double down, or to keep playing after a losing streak but the deck is hot.

**So my Total is roughly $1500 for a ""session"".**

Now, people will argue you need X times your Max Bet... etc. If you have 15-20x your Max Session = $1500 x 20 you will likely be able to stay in the game for a long long while. That's 20 trips to the casino. I go 2-3 times a month. If I lost 2 times a month out of 3, for 10 straight months, I'd still have 1/2 my bank role. That's a year of play practically. So I look at it more along the lines of ""action"" vs ""amount x wager size"".

# NOW THAT YOU'RE PLAYING

**WHEN YOU GET TO THE CASINO:**   Start by just watching a table... Casually,  from the start of a shoe (considering Six Deck). Find a table with 3 or 4 players, who are playing with a good bankroll and placing wagers larger than yours. Make sure the table you find has room for you to squeeze in, to play ideally 2 hands. If possible.

Back count the shoe from the start. And only sit down when the count goes very positive. Simple as that. Don't play the start of shoes, just start off watching. If after 5-6 rounds the deck is playing neutral, casually move on. If the deck instantly is negative, move on.

You want to find a table where the round you jump in after has moved the TC to +3 or more. If you want even more security. Go +4. The higher the TC the better your edge, however the longer the wait to find that opportunity.

**WAGER SIZE:**   Start with you base wager of your spread even on the +3 or +4 TC. Treat your +3 as a +1.

If you are spreading $25 - $250 per hand. Start at $25 for +3.

If the round you start in on throws out a lot of low cards and the deck goes even more positive in terms of True Count; adjust your wagers up from there in 2x per TC Increments. (TC = 3; $25, TC = 4; $50, TC = 5; $75 or $100

Using this method you are actually playing at an even higher edge than just playing as an AP Player would starting a new shoe. Because you are treating a hot deck as an ""ok"" deck. You are mitigating loss. Lower wagers even in fairly warm decks, will put you at a greater advantage.

**RIDE THE RIDE:**   In a high TC deck, you WANT the TC to drop. That's what you are going for. You want the ride to go as high as possible and come crashing down. And then, the ride is over. If the TC drops drastically; it means a LOT of 10s and Aces have just come out. Good for you... not the casino. After a fast or steady down to under +3 TC, the ride has come to an end.  Go for a smoke break, even if you don't smoke. Come back, then play a few rounds at **your minimum bet only.**  Then leave. Don't play ANY shoe's you aren't 100&amp;#37; of the current count, except to wong out without looking like you're wonging out (mentioned right before this).

**PLAY SIDE BETS:**     Play Side Bets to Tip the Dealer During Play... ""For Luck"" this is for you.

**NEVER PLAY SIDE BETS:**     Do Not Play Side Bets.

**TIPPING:**   If you lose, tip. If you win, tip more. If you win a lot, tip well. I typically tip on a loss session what ever my last chips are, under $10.  On a win session - $15. On a great session, $25.  Make sure to time your tipping to when the Pit Boss is there checking the Color Up / Out so they see it. You can also place Small Side Bets for the Dealer during play. But keep that to 1 $5 Side Bet per Dealer per Session. The Pit Boss wont see that if it loses. If they win, the Dealer will call it out to the floor. The Pit Boss might not even take notice. 

**YOU'VE GOT STRATEGY DOWN &amp; YOU'RE COUNTING LIKE A PRO... NOW:**  Try to learn to count Aces as a side count, or at least try to keep a rough count. You will see rounds where with 4 players and only 23 cards dealt 8 or 9 or even 10 Aces show up. This gives you a better idea of what's next. I've seen this. And knowing that a huge amount of the percentage of Aces are now gone and played out, allows you to adjust your strategy.

**SPLITTING 10s!!!!!**    Never Split 10s. If you're going to master the Illustrious 18, make it your own version, the Illustrious 17 and Never Split 10s.  Even if the count is +12. It's just a red flag and it's not worth the ""one hand"" you may or may not win. 

**SURRENDER LIKE A PRO:**     Surrender is one hell of a tool when available. Part of being an AP player is not just being able / having access to a good casino or multiple casinos; you HAVE to find good games. Personally for me, Surrender is one of the best rules to look for. 16s v D10 suck. 15s vs D10 suck. 12-14 in a High TC suck, even against a D9 - PARTICULARLY if you follow my strategy and strictly limit your action to only &gt; +3 TC Shoes. Use Surrender like crazy if the Casino Allows. I don't care what indices say based off 1 Billion Simulations. Just keep it simple. Surrender 16s vs D9, D10, DA; 15s vs D10, DA, and in High TC games &gt; + 8 I'd surrender 14s, 13s and 12s as well against a D10 &amp; DA.  In a &gt; +8 Game, a 12 will bust on anything except a neutral 7-9 or lower. The simulations my say otherwise, but the edge loss is seriously negligible. If a deck is TC +8... I will likely bust on a 14.

**ETIQUETTE:** If asked to wait by other players until the shoe is finished, pay no attention. Just get in. Have chips ready, already purchased, keep a bankroll so you don't have to buy in at the table. (Ratholing to have a ready bankroll discussed below).   Do not however enter a shoe where there is only 1-2 rounds left in the actual shoe. Its a waste of time.

**CHA-CHING:**   If you 3x your session bankroll, leave. Only cash out 80-90&amp;#37; of your chips. Keep some chips stocked up. A.) It makes getting in on a shoe easy and fast when you arrive as you don't have to buy in or get rated.

**PLAY RATED:** While others might disagree... I'm sorry. They know who you are.  

The technology Casinos use these days is insane. They know when you arrive. License plates are read. They know who you are based on ID checks. They have facial recognition at all casinos. They match you to your player ""profile"" right away. They have RFIDs in all chips, they know all the moves by all the people and who they are. The RFID scanners built into the tables can read roughly 600 chips every 2-3 seconds. They know where every chip goes. Every wager is tracked.  **Just play rated,** it makes you appear more like a patron rather than someone who's trying to appear unnoticed and ""covert"". Secondly, if you're going to hit the same Casino often... BE a Patron. You'll likely become friendly with some of the staff. The movies like 21 depict highly covert and OPSEC procedures. But look, unless you have a bankroll to play $5000 hands and bring down the house... Just play rated and act normal.

**EMOTIONS:**  Never stray from strategy or let emotions take over. Just lost 4 hands in a row in high TC? Can't believe the dealer just got 3 - yes THREE BJs in a row? GUESS WHAT. It's not your turn to win... focus on the strategy and forget the fact that shit happens and yes, sometimes you will lose. More than once in a row. But if you do the above... you'll come back.

**RATHOLING:** Not like ploppies;  but keep a decent amount of quarters or nickels every time you leave in terms of your profit, it reduces your cash out (However the casino knows you have the chips), but the real reason, it makes your next visit a breeze. When you find that first perfect hot shoe, you can sit down and bet. Not have to buy in, have the money pen tested, have the dealer call color out.... the Pit Boss comes over, rates you... That slows the game and annoys people. You rathole chips just to have a bankroll of chips to play with next time. I keep roughly $1000 in hand.

**BEVERAGES:**  Drink. Coffee and nothing else. No Sugar. You don't want a sugar crash. You wan't the caffeine kick for added attention and increased mood- which caffeine helps with.  Do not drink ANY alcohol. Would you have a Vodka Tonic before your Calculus Test? It's timed by the way. Stick with coffee.  If you really think OPSEC / Cover is necessary, which it isn't because what you're sipping at the table is not what they are looking for; buy a glass of sparkling water at the bar when arriving, have them add a twist of lime. 

ATTIRE**:**  Casual. I play in jeans, chucks, and a t-shirt. Don't invest in any fake noses, wigs, or even sun glasses as most casinos don't allow even the shades except in the Poker Room.

blackjack,First time Vegas Strip Blackjack,"First time headed to vegas.  I tried my best at reading up on all the blackjack games and the variations from casino-to-casino.  I usually play at PA casinos or AC casinos, so reading about the slight differences (like only allowed double on 10/11) makes me surprised.  Which casinos have the best game for $5-25 min.  I have read from various forums about El Cortez, which I plan on playing at; but what about the strip?  I read that treasure island has the best, but I wanted to preferably stay on the south side of the strip (aria, bellagio, nyny, etc).  Thanks for your help guys!"
blackjack,Phoenix casino recommendations?,I will be traveling to phoenix for a few days and will likely hit up a few casinos while i'm there. Which ones would you recommend. Thanks! 
blackjack,Quick strategy question.,"Playing BJ with a slightly different rule then I'm used to. After splitting instead of being dealt another card and then having the option to stay/hit/double, in this version I get the option immediately with just the split card. 
    
For example if I split 9's I'm used to getting another card(let's say 2) and then having the option to hit/double. In this game I have to hit/double right away so I would then follow basic strategy and double vs 6 or less, and hit vs 7 and above. 
    
My question is with the ruleset should I ever be splitting 10's against weaker cards(4-5-6) since I get the option to double right away? Or what other strategy would you do differently. Also would you say this variation gives the house a higher edge or is about the same? "
blackjack,Does this blackjack strategy work??,"So I’m a very novice blackjack player. I’ve only gone to the casino a handful of times and I wanted to get some advice on a particular strategy.

I’m not sure what the odds are of the dealer busting, but I feel like it’s safe to assume he/she will bust within 5-6 hands.
 
So let’s say you start with a really small bet ($5) you lose the hand. You double the bet ($10), you lost that hand as well (down $15) 

Then you double your second bet ($20) and you win that hand. You have just made back the money you lost and $5.

Could you not just do this over and over again? Because you have to assume you are going to win at least 1/5-6 hands?

I could be off the rocker, as I mentioned I’m a very novice gambler.

Here’s how much you would have to start with

First Hand: $5 ($5)
Second Hand: $10 ($15)
Third Hand: $20 ($35)
Fourth Hand: $40 ($75)
Fifth Hand: $80 ($155)

You would only need $155 in chips to begin if it goes to 5 hands. And I guess you could lose 5 hands straight, it just seems very unlikely!

Is there a name for this type of gambling?
Is it legal?
Any advice would be great!"

My last session I played a single table with a defective ASM. After each shoe the dealer would have to remove the new shoe, then run it again through the ASM. 

I asked the Pit Boss who supervised each 2nd Shuffle (which lasted 3 minutes) about it. Basically the ASM would stop after 3 minutes rather than keep running which is standard operating mode while the other shoe is in play. 

I guess they viewed it as 3 minutes wasn’t enough shuffle. So each deck was run twice. 

Anyone seen this before? Wondering how this might affect clumping of cards of the deck removed. 

I always cut the deck as close to the end as possible. 

My session that night was good. Started in with $1000 buy in playing $25 as my initial wager on two hands. Spreading $25 up to $175 max bet. 

Ended up with $2700 in under 2 hours and colored out.

blackjack,Running count Ko,"I am learning to count with KO. I have a couple questions regarding keeping the count. For those of you who count with KO, do you start the round with the running and add the count for the round to the running count, or do you just use the running count during the round?

Ex. Round starts at 3. The count for the round is 2. Ending count is 5.

Or

Roind starts at 3. After scanning the table, you do: 1, 0, 2, 4, 5, etc. As the cards are dealt.

I hope that explanation makes sense.

Second question: I've heard people say they use a system to remember the running count in their head so they aren't sitting there saying the number over and over in their head. Some people say they picture the number in the mind. Others say that they have mnemonic devices for each number. What do you associate with different numbers? "

blackjack,Peak/Squeeze Feature On Live Dealer Blackjack,"Have been discussing this with some friends after a very drunken night in a casino playing for a bit more than we should have, and having an absolute blast.   


The dealer was kind enough to slowly squeeze the next card coming and give us a peak anytime she had 12\+ \(one monkey to busting\).   


Maybe this was tequila, but I found this to be a much more entertaining way to play so now I wonder why some of the top online providers \(such as Evolution Gaming\) have not implemented this on their super VIP tables?   


They let you change the dealer anytime already, so wouldn't it be amazing to dictate the dealing speed on these VIP tables? Minimum balance to sit down is 6k on them, so surely they would not be worried about overhead...

Thoughts? \(I work in the industry and have connections with some live dealer providers, so any awesome ideas that could push the industry forward would be appreciated!\)"
blackjack,What would you do if the dealer gives you extra money?,"Playing Blackjack today, was at the peak of my profit for the day, wanted to cash out £150 (15 £10 chips), so I told the dealer I'd like 2 pinks (£100 each) &amp; 2 blacks (£25 each). I didn't do this intentionally, it was a slip of the tongue and I obviously meant 1 pink (slept for like 4 hours this morning). But he did in fact give me £250 (He's fairly new and I can see he's finding it a bit difficult to get all the stuff down, and he was definitely tired too). I was confused for a moment but once I realised he'd given me an extra £100 I just couldn't keep it. I felt bad, and was worried that if it was found out he gave me an extra £100 it might have a negative repercussion on him (I mean mistakes happen and if he was experienced it wouldn't have mattered much). Sometimes dealers pay out an odd tenner or fiver on losing hands etc but that's negligible. Everyone around the table realised too, but I gave it back to him and told him what had happened. 

What would you guys do in this situation? Is it sinister to keep it? Realistically that £100 is not even significant compared to the total amount of money I've spent in the place, so is it really ""stealing"" from the casino?

blackjack,Splitting 8s vs Surrender,"I just had my max bet out on a s17, 6d game playing 2 hands. Got 8s on the first, 18 on the second, dealer showed 10. Running count of 17 by the time i had to choose what to do, with about 1.5-2 decks left. Horrible, gut wrenching feeling. I split them and got 18 and 17 and the dealer pulled a 9 to beat all 3 of my hands. 

Anyone know the god damned index for surrender 8s s17 6Deck so I can know if I fucked up or not? I can’t stop thinking about it, and why I didn’t just SURRENDER (which was an option). "

blackjack,Preferential shuffling...,"So, there is a casino fairly local to me that has a rule for all dealers to shuffle if *any* player at their table spreads more than 4-1 on their single and double deck games. 

At first, this annoyed me. This shop  used to have some of the best games around. They've gotten new management in the past year and it's gone down hill. My GF *loves* the hotel, the Spa and the other resort amenities the property offers. I jyst hate the BJ here. 

She had a comp to an executive suite with $250 comped $ to the Spa included over the weekend, so I reluctantly went along. 

I'm always looking for some sort of an angle on things. So, what I started doing was spreading 6 or 7 units when the count was negative and forcing them to shuffle away bad shoe after bad shoe, per their rigid rules.  I  made them shuffle up anytime I wanted, it was kind of fun, TBH. So, when the count was positive, I'd spead up to 4 units and when it was negative, I'd force a shuffle. I really didn't think I'd get away with this for long, but, to my suprise, I did this for about six hours and left on my own accord. Maybe the ""geniuses"" who run this native casino think that their little rule made them not have to worry about counters or something? I don't know. They seemed to not give a damn at all.  Granted, I was fortunate and had some pretty extreme positive varience,  but I was just turning lemons into lemonade here. I don't expect this to work every time. Still, I  made a 100 unit profit. Just $25 units on this trip since the game type and betting restrictions limited me to that, even still, $2500 profit in six hours of play in what were unfavorable conditions was  pretty fun. A lot more fun than what my only other reasonable option for gambling was on this trip, playing cash games in the poker room. I get really, really bored playing Hold 'em, but that's just me. I:m also only a slightly above average poker player. My skiillset in poker is no where near the level my blackjack game is at. BONUS: my girl was happy with the Spa too, so win-win. 

I'm wondering if any of you might have stories where you took a bad game and made it more playable? Was it a side bet that you found an exploit on? Was it something else?

blackjack,Etiquette when playing multiplayer blackjack?,"I went to a casino for the first time. I put in $100 and got $170 back. 

But I didn't know how to play and some person kinda guided me but when I started to receive bigger payouts she started getting irritated. 

Like when I got an Ace+4 on my first deal I didn't know whether to do the hand swipe or tap, so I tapped and got a 6 then hand swiped. The woman (right after me) was pissed off because she already had like a 9+7 or 6+7 and was dealt a 5. And was telling me ""you should come back when you get better"" and things like that. 

Not that she put me down but I seemed to have made more than the others at the table 🤔 

So my question stands, is there a certain etiquette to games like this?"

blackjack,Summer Blackjack Advice,"Hi everyone.

Hobbyist here. But have just recently put together a decent bankroll and have decided to make a semi\-serious push at some advantage blackjack this summer. Goal is to hit 10,000 rounds by the end of September.

I've got my ROR, spread, etc. figured out for the games in my area with CVCX. But where I need advice is how to approach the games from a heat/longevity standpoint so I can actually hit 10,000 rounds without getting shut down first. I'll have access to six different casinos, so I don't need to stay completely clean. Also I'm in the Midwest.

Should I worry about getting ID'd? Or should I just get in there and get the rounds in?

Player's card yay or nay?

Should I be hitting the obvious most EV\+ targets? \(e.g. double deck vs 6 deck\) Even if that gives more heat?.

How many hours should I generally expect to get in before getting backed off? \(obviously this is dependent on the casino, but I'd be curious what others have experienced\)

Is a 10,000 round goal feasible?

Is there other potential pitfalls that I'm not even thinking about?

I don't mind if at the end of this I'm barred from all six places, but I want to give myself the best shot to hit 10k rounds and at the very least make sure I don't get barred for doing something stupid."

blackjack,Counting CSMs II: This is not a troll post,"Call me a crank or not, but I have some solid mathematical reasons for investigating a CSM play that does *not* relate to latency of redistribution. Specifically, I need to know how many cards are held in the output buffer until it's replenished with cards from a new compartment. Again, this does *not* have to do with latency of redistribution.

Ideally I could acquire a CSM, but they're expensive and hard to find. I would consider asking a dealer school if I could take a CSM usage class, but I doubt they'd have one or would be willing to let me operate it without the shroud. I read the patent, but it left the exact number abstract. (""In one embodiment, the apparatus 21 is programmed to substantially constantly maintain a “buffer” ... of a selected number of cards, for example 20 cards, in the second receiver. A buffer of more or less cards may be selected.""). Does this mean that the default is 20 and no one bothers reprogramming it?

Does anyone know more about this output buffer? I know that many others have said that CSMs getting harder to beat, is that because this buffer has gotten smaller?

Also, does a one2six have 40 compartments or 50?

Thanks a lot in advance."

blackjack,"Did something pretty stupid yesterday and caught some heat, not sure how long to lay off.","So yesterday, I was at a $5 table that I go to about 4 days out of the month. I've never really experienced anything that I thought was heat, but yesterday, I turned $100 into about $400 pretty quickly, as the first 2 shoes that I played in were very quickly at TC 3+ and stayed around there for much of the shoe. A few $20 double downs and splits, etc, and I was up to around $400. 

Anyway, I ended up wonging out of the next couple shoes, because they went TC -2, by going to the restroom for quite a while (10+ minutes) twice in the span of like 30 minutes. My pot was still around $450 when I ended up realizing I've caught the attention of the pit boss, who is standing right next to the dealer just staring at me as I ""text"" on my phone, etc, etc.

Anyway, I decided I need to stay in the next few shoes no matter the count, and just bet the $5 minimum to hopefully get the heat off me. Anyway, I had a shoe go to a TC -15 with only like 1.5 decks left in the shoe. I was pretty astonished. The pit boss was still just staring at our table, and most directly at me, for like at least 20 minutes. Anyway, I decided I should probably throw in a few bets above the minimum to further throw off any heat. 

I happen to put a $15 bet on what ended up being the last hand if the shoe. Cut card came out after the first card was dealt, and the pen was great, so we're talking a TC of like -20 to -25 with something like 40 cards left in the shoe. I was dealt 3,3 against a dealer 6.

$15 bet, fuck it, let's split em. Split 3's, I get another 3. Fuck it, Split again. 

I have $45 bucks out there on a negative 20 count. I really don't know what the fuck was going on, but I got dealt a 9 on the first hand. With the count so low, I figured there was only like 7 or 8 face cards left in the shoe, so I (stupidly) DOUBLED DOWN on a hard 12. dealt an 8. 20, nice.

Next 3? Another 9. I can't not double down now, so I double down again. Dealt a 5, fine.

Last 3? Dealt another 3. Split again. Dealt a 9. DOUBLE DOWN AGAIN. Dealt a 4, fine.

Actual last 3? Dealt an 8, double down, dealt a 2.

Dealer ends up busting on a 5 card bust. Showing 6, opens up a 2, then pulls a 3, 2, and then 10.

It was pretty stupid, and I really don't know who the fuck in their right mind doubles down on a hard 12 unless they know there are barely any 10s left in the shoe. Anyway, I was paid out something like only $120 which is surely peanuts to a casino's $5 table, but then the people around my table got a little loud and caused some commotion and the pit boss came over, and said to the dealer ""Why don't you color him up, he's ready for the $10 table.""

I've been to this casino maybe 10 times for a total of, say, 60-70 hours and I've played rated for probably half of that. The pit boss said it with a little bit of a chuckle, and the dealer actually motioned to me to push in all my chips and colored me up to blacks. Being younger than the average casino goer, I felt pretty intimidated and I actually went over to the $10 table and sat down. I was pretty flustered and just entered mid-shoe, played like 10 hands and then cashed out and left.

TL;DR: TC of -20 with a deck or so left in the shoe at a $5 table, I split 3's 3 times, and doubled down on hard 12 3 times, and won. Pit boss (jokingly? not sure) asks the dealer to color me up, but then lets me play at the $10 table without really giving a fuck.

Anybody have any thoughts? Did I just get intimidated and it made me act like a little bitch or did I get backed off. I'm not really sure if I should go back there for a couple months or something."

blackjack,New to counting,"Hello all, I'm new to the counting formula, and was interested because I'm a huge math enthusiast.  I've been told, and done some research that your True count is your running count multiplied by the percentage left.  I.E. in a 4 deck stack, If my count is \+5 and there's 204/208 cards left, then my True count will be 5 \* 1/2 or 2.5.  Since doing say 497 remaining at a \+5 count would be 5 \* \(497/508\) this is a lot of math to do in your head.  I was told to just do based on eyeballing easy arithmetic based percentages, probably for the best.  I'm just new to the lingo like ""playing indexes"" etc.  I've just been having lots of fun doing the pure mathematics of counting, so hopefully some of you all might like to give some resources for learning or expanding knowledge?

Later I decided to return to the original casino and was up again about 20% but overstayed my luck and lost it again. Lesson learned tonight: pick and choose my tables as little better. I stayed a whole shoe even though I knew the count was way in the negative early and the table upped there minimum to 15 but I liked the couple guys playing and the dealer so I stayed. Should I have just walked away after that first win and called it a night? I live in biloxi so this isn't a weekend trip if that matters

blackjack,Weird things in Reno,"Currently on my first trip in Reno. A few differences I noticed from Vegas: they put all the cards after the cut card in the discard tray at the beginning rather than at the end then discard another 15 to 20 % of the deck at the end. Is this to make it harder for deck estimation or to make it look like penetration is greater than it is? I used an unbalanced count so it didn’t affect me anyway. Also all double deck games don’t have double after split, which I learned after splitting a pair of sevens. I would have won more money and was a little pissed. He told me that you can only do that in shoe games. I told him that’s stupid, you can double after split for most double deck games in Vegas. He said he didn’t believe me and I rebutted that that money that I didn’t win was his tip money for the night.

blackjack,Standard Deviations When Changing Bets Based on TC,"So I’m aware of the regular standard deviation formulas, but what I can’t find anywhere is when you change your bet based on the frequency of hands per hour at each count to get a standard deviation for the hour. 

Is it:

(sqrt(TC +1 unit^2 x hands bet at TC +1 /hr) + Sqrt(TC +2 unit^2 x hands bet at TC +2/hr) + ....) x 1.1 

Or (sqrt(TC +1 unit^2 x hands bet at TC +1/hour) x 1.1) + (sqrt(TC +2 unit^2 x hands bet at TC +2/hour) x 1.1) + ....

Or none of those? The order of operations when it gets that long is tripping me up and I’m not sure what would be an acceptable number. Basically if TC 1 comes up 34/100 hands per hour and I bet 3 units and TC 2 comes up 13/100 per hour and I bet 6 units and so on for all TCs and frequencies, what would an hourly SD be?"

&gt; The counters then consider the difference between the most abundant and least abundant suits. This difference is then converted to a true count, and if that count is sufficiently large, the AP has the advantage.

so, the RTP of the side bet is favorable when there is an uneven distribution of suits. does that mean it's at it's least favorable in the very beginning of a deck, when there is an even distribution of suits? that would mean it would never go below the default house edge, which doesn't sound right. maybe someone who is better at math can explain how this is calculated."

blackjack,I heart ploppies!,"I'll admit it, I love ploppies! The main reason is simple. I'd guess the majority of people in this subreddit are either AP's or at least trying to improve their game and reduce the house edge.

If it weren't for ploppies, game conditions would get worse. If they weren't making money at all, they'd stop offering blackjack *entirely* or it would be all but unplayable. 

Yes, they can slow the game down and that's not good for our per hour rates, but they are a nessasary evil. I have a full-time AP friend who hates them because, she says, ""They waste cards on positive counts."" I can see her point, but, TBH, it's pure Gambler's fallacy IMO.

I motion hit, the dealer thought I said stand so they give the card to the next person who is already motioning hit. The card is face up, and out off the dealers hand at this point.  

Once the person next to me sees that it's a Queen (and busting their hand) they point out that I said hit and not stand. The dealer asks me what I said and all I said was ""yeah, I said hit"" because I was down a good amount of money and planning to leave the table soon anyways. The dealer moves the queen back to my hand (busting my hand) and flips the next card for the person next to me which ""unbusted"" their hand.

blackjack,Tricks for maintaining count at the table,"Hello everybody at the table!

At this point I'm comfortable and can maintain a count in house and somewhat at the tables. However, over time on an 8deck game I can't hold my focus and get side\-tracked whether it be a dealer talking, somebody at the table or just my own thoughts and emotions of the upswings and downswings of the game. 

How do you all hold your attention and focus for the duration of the shoe? I can maintain the count at home with music and family talking to me but when I get to the table in the casino things change. Ill start off good then I get caught off guard and asking myself where I was on my count and go like ""fk!"" 

Looking for tricks and tips on this subject of How to keep the count for long periods of time. 

Probably have around 40\-60 hours of counting and still going strong yet I feel like I'm missing something. 

Feedback is appreciated :\)"
blackjack,Best way to improve.,"Hey guys. I'm pretty new to this sub as well as blackjack in general. I didn't know if I should post; but fuck it.

To start, I want to say that I knew before going into this that I wasn't ready and that I was bound to lose money. It was simply a test to see where I stood.

I have decided to delve into Blackjack, and I have decided on KO as my counting system. I have been studying basic strategy, and thought I had it down. I knew I wasn't at 100%, but I felt I was very close.

This last weekend, my girlfriend and I went up to Vegas for a family emergency, and before we left, we decided to hit up a couple casinos and play for a bit. We decided on South Point. The atmosphere is just what I needed to loosen up enough to sit at a table. 

I sat down with $50, and walked away with about $35. I was rabbit-holing my winnings, and when my pile of $50 went away, I left. I think I played through about three shoes. Here's what I learned:

* I am not good with basic addition, apparently. 

I don't know if it's the pressure or trying to think of strategy as the cards are coming out, but adding up my hand total took way too long. It's literally as if I forgot basic math. Has anyone else had this issue. If so, is this just something that comes with time, or is it something that you use certain drills to overcome?

* People are **NOT** fuckin' around when they say Know Basic Strategy like the back of your hand.

They really mean **KNOW IT**. Hard totals I'm pretty good on. Very confident, actually. And, I've got pairs *almost* down, but soft totals have me lost. So, I know I need to work a lot more on that. Every book I read has said not only should I be able to recite it, but it should take zero mental energy to know which play to make. I'm glad I saw how much more I need to practice.

* Counting is a lot more difficult than I had thought.

I knew that I was nowhere near ready to count, but I took a shot at it anyway to see where I stood. I couldn't even keep a count past the first hand. Basically, a lot of practice is needed there as well.

It was a good experience to see exactly where I stand. If anyone has any kind of tips on how they learned, please let me know."

blackjack,Question about soft 17 in basic strategy,"So i have seen a lot of charts saying to double a soft 17 on dealer 3-6 otherwise hit. Shouldnt you just stay on soft 17 since if you count it as a 7, then you HAVE to draw a 10 just to get back to your original number. Or you dont draw a 10 and you have less than what you had before?
So isnt staying on a soft 17 better or is there something im missing?"
blackjack,CTRs and Cashing Out with Cover,"So I’m interested in seeing the different ways that everyone cashes out. I’ve heard and read that at $10k the casino will ask for a CTR in which you would have to give your name and info.

2. Does this worry anyone about blown cover?

3. How is it avoided in higher stakes where coming with $10k and leaving with $12k is pretty standard? 

4. Is this anything to worry about in general?

Any info or stories welcome!

Edit: Also taking chips and cashing later. Anyone worried about leaving and not being able to? Do you only do it if you’re staying in the hotel itself?"

blackjack,Which of these has the highest house advantage?,"After listening to the ""Millennial Gambler"" episode on the Gambling with an Edge podcast, I decided to play $1 hands online at Bovada using Basic Strategy.  I've actually been doing pretty well.  And now I'm wondering which game has the highest house advantage so I can play the one with the lowest house advantage.  

Six deck game: Shuffled after each hand
- Dealer hits on soft 17.
- Blackjack pays 3 to 2.
- Split up to three hands.
- Surrender any first two cards.
- Split Aces receive only one card.
- No re-splitting of Aces.

Double Deck game: Shuffled after each hand
- Dealer stands on soft 17.
- Blackjack pays 3 to 2.
- Split one hand only
- No surrender
- Split Aces receive only one card.
- Double on any two cards

Single Deck: Shuffled after each hand
- Dealer hits on soft 17
- BJ pays 3 to 2
- Split up to two hands
- No surrender
- Split aces receive one card
- No re-splitting aces


So yea, which of these options has the lowest house advantage?  I've been playing the 6-deck game so far and have done well but wondering if the single deck or double deck game would be a better option.  Thanks!

blackjack,Does playing 2 hands double ev?,I recently purchased Cvcx. When I click the play two hands options it seems that my ev essentially doubles which seems to make sense.

blackjack,Sad experience,"I sat down at an empty $5 table today so I assumed I was entering a new shoe. To my dismay I saw about 1/2 deck in the burn pile. 

Whatever, I didn't have much time left so I thought I'd just play BS until the shoe ended. I thought I would just count the cards anyway and If itgot real negative I would leave. Btw, I never enter mid shoe. 

All of a sudden the count went up to about +20 with 5 decks left and stayed there until the end (80% pen). Halfway through I started betting like $60 and ended up going to like 75. Won 300 off the shoe but i couldn't help but feel like I lost since I should have been betting way more. 

Just thought it was pretty sad that the one time I jump in midshoe it turns out to be the highest count I've ever seen (probably) and I lost outon what could have been a once in a lifetime (+20 tc) shoe. "

blackjack,El Cortez,"Just wanted to let you all know that El Cortez in Las Vegas, well known sweat joint for APs, has now implemented CSM(continuous shuffle machines).
Now this is not for all tables. They still offer a few single deck games as well as some double deck games. I walked onto the floor this evening after making some pocket money at another Downtown establishment and was surprised to see multi-deck signs on the tables that just one week ago were either double or single deck games.
I took a round on the floor and there were about four tables with these hideous CSMs on the left of the dealer.
What stuck out more was hat people were actually playing em and I rushed out back to the garage.
Might be a taste of what is to come, but I sure hope El Cortez does not convert over entirely.

blackjack,Strategy and Betting Advice for Casual Players.,"**10 Tips and Tricks for non-AP players.**

**1)** Learn basic strategy.  Its really not that hard.  Print a graphical chart.  Learn the patterns.  No, seriously.  MEMORIZE IT.

* *This actually the most effective thing you can do to lower the house edge.*

**2)** Play at full tables where people are laughing, joking, and having fun.

* *Full tables don't play as many hands per hour and you don't have an advantage, remember?  People goofing around also helps slow down play, besides you are there to have fun, right?*

**3)** Learn Basic Strategy.

* *i mean, know every combination, for every hand, for every upcard.  You can do it!*

**4)** If you have a multi-card 16, with a 4 or 5 in your hand, don't hit versus dealer's 10 even though the basic strategy you just learned says to hit.

* *Likewise, if there are a couple of 4s and 5s showing on the board at that full table you are playing at, don't hit that 16 vs T.*

**5)** Learn Basic Strategy.

* *Did I mention completely memorizing this stuff?*

**6)** If at your full table (I did tell you to play at full tables, right?) almost everybody gets dealt a 20 or maybe a bunch of 20s and one 19, and the dealer turns over a blackjack, or even worse, a couple of 20s AND some blackjacks AND the dealer has two face cards -- Leave the table until the next shoe, bro.

* *The true count just dropped at least -2.5 on that round. You are playing the rest of the shoe at a big disadvantage, or if there was a positive count, it just shot it's wad, too bad, better luck next time.*

**7)** LEARN BASIC STRATEGY

* *No, I mean really know that stuff in your sleep.*

**8)** If at your full table (you are always at a full table), everybody gets dealt hands under 12, one guy hits like 4 times and still only has 18, there still isn't any 10s until the dealer is showing a 6 and turns his 16 into 21 with 5 -- Moan and groan with the rest of the table, but remember to bump up your bet on the next round.

* *The true count just went up at least +2.5 on that round.  You have an advantage, or at worst, you were really negative and are now even so you just have the normal house edge on a bigger bet.  Gamble!*

**9)** A,4 vs dealer's 4.  Don't know what to do?  Go back to step 1) above.

* *There.  That is your 10th step.*

blackjack,Does Penetration Really Make Any Difference over the Long Run?,"I always hear deck penetration is very important. But I'm having trouble understanding intuitively why.

It seems like a TC of +5 is just as good near the beginning of the shoe as near the end as far as the statistics go over the long term. I understand that near the end of the shoe, the variance is much lower because the count is more accurate. But it seems like even though the count isn't as accurate near the beginning of the shoe, it is equal chance of being better or worse than what you think and those should balance out over the long run.

For example, if you think the count is +5 near the beginning of the shoe, you raise your bet. There is a good chance that you won't get the high cards coming out you expected. But there is also a good chance you will get even more high cards coming out than you expected. Does this make sense?"
blackjack,Can one still make a living counting cards?,"I hear a lot about people getting kicked out, the proliferation of facial recognition software, and the sharing of data between casinos of known counters.

But that blackjack doesn't contribute to the rollover requirement.  Has anyone else come across this problem?  Wondering how you handled it.

STRATEGY

Use the [Wizards Strategy](https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/basics/#toc-Wizard27sSimpleStrategy)*

Never split 4s, 5s, 10s  
Always split 8s, As  
Split others if dealer under 7  

Double down 10, 11 if higher than dealer  
Double down 9, soft 7, soft 8 if dealer under 7  

Always stand on soft 19+ 
Dealer under 7: stand on hard 12+, soft 18+
Dealer 7+: stand on hard 17+

Never take insurance  
If double not allowed, hit, except soft 18  
Surrender 16 vs 10  

* A much simplified version (with only 21 cells versus 250!) of Basic Strategy, less effective by 0.14%, but easily offset by counting as below. 

COUNTING

Use modified [Knockout](https://www.blackjacktactics.com/blackjack/strategy/card-counting/ko/)* method

Start a running count from +2  
Count 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as +1  
Count 10, A as -1  

If running count = decks x 4, time to raise your bets. (See section below). So playing against one deck, raise if count reaches +4, against 8 decks if count hits +32, etc.

When raising bets, you may also take insurance. 

* Mathematically identical to KO but modified to avoid a mostly negative running count in the original system. 

BETTING

Use a simplified [Kelly Criterion](https://www.blackjacktactics.com/blackjack/articles/kelly-criterion/)* system

Bankroll of 500 units  
Start betting 1 unit  
Occasionally bet 2 or 3 units  
When count favourable (see above), bet 4 units  
For each extra +1, raise bet +1 to maximum 10  

For example, playing against six decks, your count starts at +2, betting 1 unit and occasionally 2 or 3 units to avoid looking like an obvious counter. If your count hits +24 (6x4), bet 4 units. If count hits +25 bet 5 units, +27 bet 7 units, +30 bet 10 units. If count drops below +24, return to minimum bets. 

* Proven to be mathematically optimal.

blackjack,BlackJack in Vegas VS France,"I went in Las Vegas few months with a friend for a professional project and this is where I learned to play BlackJack good with basic strategy and even counting cards. We played a lot in Downtown old casinos. I just want to show you the differences, in Vegas people almost never make mistakes and they even laughed at us one night because we didn't hit a soft 18. In France I saw people spliting 10's, they double down on 12 or 13. I see also a lot of people staying on 12 against 9 etc...

In France the black jack rule is a no hole card so everytime we go to the casino stupid people almost insults us and get mad when we are the last players to play even if we strictly  follow the basic strategy. For example I hit a 15 on a 9 people will laugh and get mad at me because ""I hit too much"" and this is even worst if the dealer get a good card.
Sometimes they also say I saved the table because I didn't hit or because I hit lol like if they know what precise card will come after mine.


All this is to say that it really makes me angry and this kills the atmosphere of the table specially when this comments comes from noobs who splits 10's

blackjack,Some questions at blackjack,"1) Why should you never take insurance? 
If the dealer has an Ace showing, statistically isn't there more cards with a 10 value? Similar to the logic that you assume the dealer's face down card is a 10.

2) Why do you always split 8's? Even against a 5-6 value?

3) Why does it mean as a ""free hit"" when you have a Ace 7?
And why should you always hit an Ace 7?

4) When you hand is composed of multiple Aces, is there a 11 value and a 1 value? Like if your hand is A A A 3, is that 6 or 16?"

The gamble is this: once the dealer has their first card showing you can place a side bet on whether or not he will bust. If he busts on a 5 or 6 you get even money. More if he busts on cards that are more unlikely to bust. I understand the dealer bust rate on average is about 42 % (I think?).

blackjack,Counted for the first time,"Been practicing for a little while, wanted to try the real deal. Overall it went okay...played through 5 shoes, came out ahead 175. I lost the count a few times though. I found it easier to keep it when there were several players. When it was just me and the dealer it was more difficult.

It was 8 deck, 80-85% pen. The only shoe games they had were $25 minimum. Everything else was those stupid CSM. A few times the count was heavy and I bet heavy I hit 20’s or A10. Felt pretty cool knowing that might happen. 

Any tips people have, other than not playing before you’re ready and playing at tables with smaller minimums? I definitely need to practice some more before I head back.

blackjack,People buying in for table minimum,"So, last night, at Mohegan Sun, the dealer shuffled and, as she was about to deal the first card, a gentleman asked if he could join – not one to ever tell people what to do with their money, I told him it was ok by me — he bought in for 200 (at a $100 minimum table) — he bet it on the first hand and lost – he then asked if we could wait while he went to the ATM – sure, why not — he came back with another 200 and, once again, lost it on the first hand — he then asked AGAIN if we would wait – at this point, I told him to take his time as I was switching tables.

I see this all the time where people will buy in at a 100 table with 100 or 200 -- these are not just people back counting or walking buy to play not heir way out of the casino - but people who appear to want to play a session.

Dealer ended up busting, but is this standard?  I guess I'm used to cards from a poker perspective that once they hit the muck they're dead and the hand should be re-dealt.

Likewise, what if someone agreed to let you add to their bet, and then purposely blew the hand just to make you lose. Ex. They hit hard 20 just to screw with you. Would the pitboss/floorman not allow them to do that play, or just refund you the money? "
blackjack,"Strong Positive Variance, Calculations Requested.","Played at Harrah’s in AC over the weekend and ran into an extremely hot deck and good variance. My calculations ran about a 3% probability, but I know others have much more advanced software so I’m interested...

H17, DAS, no hitting split aces, 3:2 BJ

TC&lt;0 - 0 units
TC0 - 3 units
TC1 - 3 units
TC2 - 4
TC3 - 5
TC4 - 6
TC5 - 7
TC6 - 7
TC7 - 8
TC8 - 8

I also realize this isn’t even a 1:3 spread and needs to be revised for future play.. (what is suggested as conservative and aggressive?)

Results: 60-75 mins actually playing. Played a couple hands at a different table, left and played a full shoe at another. Started with 40 units, ended with 103 units. Total: +63 units 

Edit: Starting and Ending BR and table time added."
blackjack,What would you do?,"

I’ve got basic strategy and red seven count down perfectly, including the changes you make you basic strategy when the count is higher. But my bankroll is only $500 right now. I want to go to the casino and start playing but the only $5 min tables around me are shoe games.  And although you can wong in and out, it takes so long for the count in a shoe game to be high. For the single and double deck games here is no mid-entry and it is $10-$15 min bets. 

Is it possible to win anything at all playing shoe games?  If I play basic strategy and bet high if the count ever does get high do you think I have a chance of winning $50-$200? That’s my goal. 

I’m wondering if I should try the single and double deck games. Even though the min bets are high, you have a chance of the flint being high. 

Not sure what to do...."

What is my risk of ruin with bankroll of $10, 000:  
and What is my bankroll required for a RoR of 20%:  

Edit: I forgot to add in 8-deck, 3:2"
blackjack,Player cards?,"From my time on the subreddit I've noticed a general advice to stay away from player cards completely — can someone elaborate as to what's wrong with getting a player card just for the rewards and just not use it when sitting down?

I got one before I started counting and have just been getting free room comps since, so a bit conflicted as to if I should pursue it at other casinos."
